The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build is failing during the installation of dependencies with the following error:
- `npm error code EBADPLATFORM`
- `npm error notsup Unsupported platform for @rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc@4.45.0: wanted {"os":"win32","cpu":"x64"} (current: {"os": "linux"})`
- `npm error notsup Valid os: win32`
- `npm error notsup Actual os: linux`

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the package causing the error (`@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc@4.45.0`) is in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. Since the error is related to platform mismatch (expected `win32` on `x64` but the current platform is `linux`), you'll need to address this by either:
   - Finding an alternative package that is compatible with the Linux platform.
   - If there are no alternatives, you may need to exclude the problematic package from the build process or find a way to provide compatibility for the Linux platform.
