The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to the `EBADPLATFORM` error caused by an unsupported platform for the `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc@4.44.2` package, which expects an operating system of `win32` and a CPU architecture of `x64`, but the current environment is running on a Linux operating system.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc@4.44.2` package is a required dependency by checking the `package.json` file or confirming it was committed to the repository.
2. To resolve this issue, add the `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc@4.44.2` package to the `external` configuration in your build setup, ensuring it does not get installed during the build process due to platform compatibility issues.
