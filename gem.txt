The Netlify deploy is failing due to persistent issues with Rollup's native module on Windows, despite multiple attempts to resolve it through dependency management and project rebuilds.

**New Strategy: Migrate to Bun**

Given the ongoing challenges with the current build system, the new strategy is to migrate the project to use Bun as the primary bundler. This is a significant change that involves replacing Vite, Rollup, and Esbuild.

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Install Bun:** Install Bun globally on the build environment.
2.  **Remove Vite and related dependencies:** Uninstall Vite, Rollup, Esbuild, and any associated plugins from `package.json`.
3.  **Configure Bun for React:** Update `package.json` scripts to use Bun's native bundler for building the React application. This may involve adapting the project structure or configuration to Bun's conventions.
4.  **Test Build:** Run the Bun build command to verify successful compilation.
5.  **Deploy:** Deploy the project to Netlify using the new Bun-based build process.

**Decision Rationale:**
This approach is chosen as a "Nuclear Option" (similar to Strategy 5 from the previous prompt) due to the intractable nature of the Rollup issue on the current build environment. Bun offers a fresh start with a potentially more stable and performant build system.
