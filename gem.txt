The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to an error in the file "ScheduleConsultationPage.tsx" at line 30, which indicates an "Unterminated regular expression" error.

**Solution:**
1. In the file "ScheduleConsultationPage.tsx", go to line 30 and ensure that the regular expression syntax is correctly terminated.
   
2. Check the regular expression `/^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^\s@]+$/` at line 30 to make sure it is properly ended with `/` at the end.

3. Correct the regular expression to ensure proper termination to resolve the "Unterminated regular expression" error.

4. After fixing the regular expression, rerun the build to verify that the issue is resolved.

5. If the regular expression was correct and the issue persists, verify that the necessary packages (if any) required for the regular expression are included in the package.json file or committed to the repository.
