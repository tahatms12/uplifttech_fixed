The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to an error in the file `/src/pages/ScheduleConsultationPage.tsx` at line 30. The error is "Unterminated regular expression".

- The error is causing the build to fail with exit code 1.

### Solution
1. In the file `/src/pages/ScheduleConsultationPage.tsx` at line 30, there is an unterminated regular expression. The regex starting with `/^[^` is missing its closing delimiter.
   
2. To fix this issue:
   - Go to the specified file `/src/pages/ScheduleConsultationPage.tsx`.
   - Ensure that the regular expression at line 30 is correctly terminated with the appropriate closing delimiter (in this case, it seems to be missing `]` at the end of the regex pattern).
   - Correct the regular expression to resolve the syntax error.

By fixing the unterminated regular expression in the file, the build should succeed.
