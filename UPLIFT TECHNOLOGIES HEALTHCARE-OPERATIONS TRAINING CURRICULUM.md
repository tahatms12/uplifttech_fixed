# **C) MODULE BUILDS**

## **COURSE 0 MODULE BUILDS**

### **MODULE 0.1: PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND DELIVERY MODES (20 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Uplift's training system uses six courses (0-6) delivered through three modes: Self-Paced (you control timing), Instructor-Led (live sessions with trainer), and Blended (combination). Understanding delivery modes prevents scheduling confusion and ensures you complete training in the approved format.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Identifies which delivery mode applies to assigned course  
* Schedules training sessions appropriately for delivery mode  
* Completes self-paced modules without skipping ahead of readiness checks

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Self-Paced Delivery Mode:** Learner progresses through modules independently at their own speed within deadline parameters. Used for Courses 0, 2 Essentials track, and Course 3\.

**Instructor-Led Delivery Mode:** Trainer facilitates live sessions with fixed schedule. Used for Course 1 Intensive track simulations and Course 4 specialty template workshops.

**Blended Delivery Mode:** Combination of self-paced modules and scheduled instructor sessions. Used for Course 1 Standard track and Course 6 role-specific modules.

**Course Sequence:** Mandatory order of completion (Course 0 → Course 1 → branching based on role).

**Duration Track:** Three intensity levels (Essentials, Standard, Intensive) with different hour requirements and content depth.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Determine Your Delivery Mode and Duration Track**

1. Receive course assignment notification from training coordinator  
2. Confirm delivery mode listed in assignment (Self-Paced, Instructor-Led, or Blended)  
3. Confirm duration track assigned (Essentials, Standard, or Intensive)  
4. If Self-Paced: access course in learning management system and begin Module 1  
5. If Instructor-Led: confirm scheduled session dates and times with training coordinator  
6. If Blended: complete self-paced modules before scheduled live sessions  
7. Mark completion of each module in tracking system before proceeding to next  
8. If uncertain about mode or track: escalate to training coordinator before starting

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if delivery mode is unclear — do not guess  
* Stop if you cannot access assigned course — technical issue requires escalation  
* Stop if scheduled session conflicts with operational needs — reschedule before deadline

**Escalation Path:** Training coordinator → Supervisor → Compliance lead (if deadline at risk)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Log access timestamps for self-paced modules  
* Confirm attendance for instructor-led sessions  
* Submit completion acknowledgment for blended tracks

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1:** Learner assigned Course 0 Self-Paced. Accesses learning system, completes Module 0.1, marks complete, proceeds to Module 0.2 only after 0.1 completion confirmed in system.

**Why Compliant:** Follows self-paced sequence without skipping prerequisites.

**Compliant Example 2:** Learner assigned Course 1 Standard (Blended). Completes Modules 1-12 self-paced before attending scheduled role variant live session on Day 4\.

**Why Compliant:** Respects blended model by completing self-paced foundation before live component.

**Non-Compliant Example:** Learner assigned Course 1 Intensive but attempts Standard track to save time. Misses required simulations and policy writing workshop.

**Why Non-Compliant:** Changing assigned duration track without approval creates training gaps and audit risk.

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set (5 Repetitions):** Match scenarios to correct delivery mode (Self-Paced, Instructor-Led, Blended)

1. Course 0 completion \= Self-Paced  
2. Course 1 Module 13 role variant session \= Instructor-Led component of Blended  
3. Course 2 Standard track \= Self-Paced with optional instructor support  
4. Course 4 specialty templates workshop \= Instructor-Led component  
5. Course 3 all modules \= Self-Paced

**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** You are assigned Course 1 Standard track. Day 1 modules 1-4 are self-paced. Day 4 includes scheduled role variant session. You complete modules 1-4 on Day 1 but skip Day 2-3 modules and attend Day 4 session.

**Question:** What is the error and how do you correct it?

**Answer:** Error is skipping prerequisite modules 5-12 before Day 4 session. Correction: reschedule Day 4 session until modules 5-12 completed.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Training coordinator  
 **Learner plays:** New hire

**Trainer:** "You're assigned Course 1 Standard track starting Monday. It's blended delivery."

**Learner expected actions:**

* Confirm start date  
* Ask which modules are self-paced vs instructor-led  
* Confirm scheduled live session dates and times  
* Confirm prerequisite modules required before live sessions

**Checklist: Delivery Mode Readiness**

* \[ \] Delivery mode confirmed (Self-Paced / Instructor-Led / Blended)  
* \[ \] Duration track confirmed (Essentials / Standard / Intensive)  
* \[ \] Course sequence position verified (prerequisites completed)  
* \[ \] Access to learning system confirmed  
* \[ \] If Blended: live session dates scheduled  
* \[ \] Deadline understood and realistic  
* \[ \] Escalation path known if issues arise

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Delivery mode identification: 2 points  
* Duration track identification: 2 points  
* Sequence awareness: 2 points  
* Checklist completion: 4 points  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (10 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Course 0 uses which delivery mode? A) Instructor-Led  
 B) Self-Paced  
 C) Blended  
 D) Hybrid

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Source states Course 0 is self-paced orientation.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C (Blended) — confusion with Course 1 Standard track.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** What does "Blended" delivery mode mean? A) Mix of online and in-person  
 B) Mix of self-paced and instructor-led  
 C) Optional attendance at live sessions  
 D) Choose your own schedule

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Blended combines self-paced modules with scheduled instructor sessions.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "online vs in-person" is not the distinguishing feature; both components can be online.

**Item 3 (True/False):** You can switch from Standard to Essentials track if Standard seems too long.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Duration track is assigned based on role requirements; changing without approval creates training gaps.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — belief that tracks are learner preference rather than requirement.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Course 1 Intensive track includes which component not in Standard? A) Role variant modules  
 B) Live simulations  
 C) Final exam  
 D) Core modules 1-12

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Intensive adds live simulations and policy writing workshop.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — role variants are in all tracks.

**Item 5 (Ordering):** Arrange course sequence correctly: A) Course 1 → Course 0 → Course 3  
 B) Course 0 → Course 3 → Course 1  
 C) Course 0 → Course 1 → Course 3  
 D) Course 3 → Course 0 → Course 1

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Source mandates Course 0 first, Course 1 second, Course 3 after Course 1\.

**Item 6 (Scenario MCQ):** You are assigned Course 2 Standard (8 hours). Your supervisor says "just skim it in 2 hours." What do you do? A) Skim as directed to save time  
 B) Complete all 8 hours as assigned  
 C) Ask to switch to Essentials track  
 D) Skip Course 2 entirely

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Duration track requirements are audit standards; supervisor directive does not override.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "following supervisor" seems correct but creates compliance gap.

**Item 7 (MCQ):** Self-Paced delivery means: A) No deadlines  
 B) Learner controls timing within deadline parameters  
 C) Optional completion  
 D) Faster than Instructor-Led

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Self-paced provides timing flexibility within required completion deadlines.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "no deadlines" misunderstands flexibility.

**Item 8 (True/False):** Instructor-Led sessions can be rescheduled anytime without notice.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Rescheduling requires coordination with training coordinator and impacts other learners.

**Item 9 (MCQ):** If your delivery mode is unclear in the assignment, you should: A) Assume Self-Paced  
 B) Escalate to training coordinator  
 C) Ask a colleague  
 D) Skip until clarified

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Safe stop rule requires escalation for delivery mode uncertainty.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — assuming creates risk of wrong mode.

**Item 10 (Short Answer):** Name the three duration tracks.

**Answer:** Essentials, Standard, Intensive  
 **Rationale:** Source defines three tracks with different hour requirements.

#### **7\) QA and Audit Hooks**

**Evidence of Competence:**

* \[ \] Learner documented any scheduling conflicts  
* \[ \] Learner escalated uncertainties appropriately

**Recordkeeping Tie-Back:**

* Module 0.1 completion timestamp logged in training records system  
* Delivery mode confirmed field populated  
* Duration track confirmed field populated

---

### **MODULE 0.2: PASSING STANDARDS, ATTEMPTS, AND COOLING PERIODS (15 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Every assessment (quiz, practical, simulation) has a passing standard (usually 80%). You get limited attempts (usually 2-3). If you fail all attempts, a cooling period (waiting time) applies before retest. Understanding these rules prevents unexpected training delays and termination risk.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Checks passing standard before starting assessment  
* Tracks attempt count remaining  
* Schedules cooling period retest within policy timeframe  
* Does not attempt to bypass attempt limits

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Passing Standard:** Minimum score required to pass an assessment (expressed as percentage, e.g., 80% means 8 correct out of 10 items).

**Attempt:** Single completion of an assessment counting toward attempt limit.

**Attempt Limit:** Maximum number of tries allowed before cooling period or escalation (typically 2-3 attempts depending on assessment type).

**Cooling Period:**

Mandatory waiting period (typically 24-48 hours or as specified by policy — needs\_review for client-specific timeframes) after exhausting attempts before retest eligibility.

**Remediation Plan:** Required training intervention after cooling period before retest, addressing specific knowledge gaps.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Take an Assessment with Attempt Limits**

1. Review passing standard displayed at assessment start (typically 80%)  
2. Confirm attempt count displayed (e.g., "Attempt 1 of 3")  
3. Complete assessment within time limit if applicable  
4. Submit assessment and view score immediately  
5. If passing standard met: proceed to next module  
6. If passing standard not met and attempts remain: review missed items, study relevant module content, attempt again  
7. If passing standard not met and no attempts remain: note cooling period start date automatically  
8. During cooling period: complete assigned remediation activities (targeted study, meeting with supervisor)  
9. After cooling period ends: contact training coordinator to schedule retest  
10. If retest fails: escalate to supervisor for performance improvement plan discussion

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if assessment instructions are unclear — ask training coordinator before attempting  
* Stop if technical error occurs during assessment — report immediately; attempt may not count  
* Stop if cooling period end date is uncertain — confirm with training coordinator before retest

**Escalation Path:** Training coordinator → Supervisor → HR (if multiple cooling periods occur)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Assessment score logged automatically in system  
* Cooling period start/end dates recorded  
* Remediation activities documented in training record  
* Retest score logged separately from initial attempts

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1:** Learner takes Module 1 quiz (10 items, 80% passing, 3 attempts allowed). Scores 70% on Attempt 1\. Reviews module content focusing on missed questions. Scores 90% on Attempt 2\. Proceeds to Module 2\.

**Why Compliant:** Used attempt structure correctly, studied between attempts, met passing standard within limit.

**Compliant Example 2:** Learner fails practical evaluation after 3 attempts. Cooling period is 48 hours. Learner completes remediation exercises during cooling period. After 48 hours, contacts training coordinator, schedules retest, passes with 85%.

**Why Compliant:** Respected cooling period, completed remediation, followed retest procedure.

**Non-Compliant Example:** Learner fails quiz after 3 attempts. Creates new user account to bypass cooling period and retake immediately.

**Why Non-Compliant:** Attempt to circumvent attempt limits and cooling period violates policy and creates audit fraud risk. Results in sanctions (potentially immediate termination per acceleration clause).

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set (8 Repetitions):** Calculate passing score for different assessment sizes:

1. 10 items, 80% standard \= 8 correct required  
2. 20 items, 80% standard \= 16 correct required  
3. 15 items, 90% standard \= 14 correct required (round up)  
4. 25 items, 80% standard \= 20 correct required  
5. 12 items, 80% standard \= 10 correct required (round up from 9.6)  
6. 8 items, 100% standard \= 8 correct required  
7. 50 items, 80% standard \= 40 correct required  
8. 30 items, 85% standard \= 26 correct required (round up from 25.5)

**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** You take Course 1 Module 4 verification simulation (passing standard 90%, 2 attempts allowed). Attempt 1 score: 85%. Attempt 2 score: 88%. No attempts remain. Cooling period is 24 hours.

**Question:** What are your next three steps?

**Answer:**

1. Note cooling period start date/time (automatic in system)  
2. Complete assigned remediation (review Module 4 verification procedures and script)  
3. After 24 hours, contact training coordinator to schedule retest

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Training coordinator  
 **Learner plays:** Employee who failed quiz

**Trainer:** "You scored 75% on the Module 8 quiz. Passing is 80%. You have one attempt left."

**Learner expected actions:**

* Acknowledge score and remaining attempt  
* Ask which questions missed (if system does not show)  
* State plan to review Module 8 content before next attempt  
* Confirm no time restriction between attempts (unless policy specifies)  
* Confirm passing standard is still 80% for next attempt

**Checklist: Assessment Attempt Management**

* \[ \] Passing standard confirmed before starting  
* \[ \] Attempt count confirmed (e.g., 1 of 3\)  
* \[ \] If failed: identified missed questions or skill gaps  
* \[ \] If failed: reviewed relevant module content before next attempt  
* \[ \] If cooling period: documented start date  
* \[ \] If cooling period: completed remediation activities  
* \[ \] If cooling period: confirmed end date before requesting retest  
* \[ \] Retest scheduled through proper channel (training coordinator)

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Passing standard identification: 2 points  
* Attempt tracking: 2 points  
* Cooling period awareness: 2 points  
* Remediation completion: 2 points  
* Retest procedure: 2 points  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (10 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Typical passing standard for knowledge checks is: A) 70%  
 B) 75%  
 C) 80%  
 D) 90%

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Source states 80% as global gate for most assessments.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — 90% applies to specific practical simulations, not all assessments.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** You score 78% on a quiz with 80% passing standard. What happens? A) You pass  
 B) You fail and use one attempt  
 C) You get partial credit  
 D) You can appeal the score

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** 78% is below 80% passing standard; counts as failed attempt.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — no partial credit concept exists.

**Item 3 (True/False):** Cooling periods are optional if you feel ready to retest sooner.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Cooling periods are mandatory waiting periods after attempt exhaustion.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — misunderstanding cooling period as suggestion.

**Item 4 (Calculation):** Quiz has 15 items, 80% passing standard. How many must you answer correctly?

**Answer:** 12  
 **Rationale:** 15 × 0.80 \= 12\.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** 11 — incorrect rounding or calculation.

**Item 5 (MCQ):** After failing 3 attempts, you must: A) Wait for cooling period to end  
 B) Request immediate retest  
 C) Start a new course  
 D) Skip to next module

**Answer:** A  
 **Rationale:** Cooling period is mandatory after exhausting attempts.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — immediate retest not allowed.

**Item 6 (Scenario MCQ):** You fail a practical evaluation twice (2 attempts allowed). Cooling period is 48 hours. You find another trainer willing to retest you after 24 hours. What do you do? A) Accept the 24-hour retest to save time  
 B) Decline and wait full 48 hours  
 C) Accept but don't tell training coordinator  
 D) Ask supervisor to waive cooling period

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Cooling period is non-negotiable policy; early retest creates audit violation.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "saving time" is not a valid override.

**Item 7 (True/False):** Remediation during cooling period is optional.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Remediation is required component of cooling period.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — treating remediation as suggestion.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** Attempt limits exist to: A) Punish slow learners  
 B) Ensure knowledge mastery before proceeding  
 C) Save training time  
 D) Reduce trainer workload

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Attempt limits ensure competence before role performance begins.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — negative framing misses competence protection purpose.

**Item 9 (MCQ):** If you score exactly 80% on a quiz with 80% passing standard, you: A) Fail  
 B) Pass  
 C) Need supervisor approval  
 D) Must retest

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Meeting passing standard exactly counts as pass.

**Item 10 (Short Answer):** You exhaust attempts on Module 6 quiz. List the three required steps before retest.

**Answer:**

1. Wait for cooling period to end  
2. Complete remediation activities  
3. Contact training coordinator to schedule retest

**Rationale:** Source requires cooling period, remediation, and proper retest scheduling.

#### **7\) QA and Audit Hooks**

**Evidence of Competence:**

### **MODULE 0.3: TRAINING RECORDS AND REFRESHER CADENCE (20 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Every training activity generates a record with specific required fields (name, date, course, score, supervisor signature). These records prove compliance during audits. Additionally, training must be refreshed (repeated) based on four triggers plus client-specific cadence (needs\_review). Understanding recordkeeping prevents audit findings and ensures you know when retraining is due.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Verifies training record fields are complete after each course  
* Tracks personal refresher due dates  
* Notifies supervisor when refresher becomes due  
* Completes refresher training within required timeframe

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Training Record:** Documentation of completed training activity containing all required fields for audit verification.

**Required Training Record Fields:** Employee name, employee ID, course name/number, completion date, delivery mode, duration track, assessment scores, attempt counts, cooling periods (if applicable), supervisor signature/approval, refresher due date.

**Refresher Training:** Repeat of training content at specified intervals to maintain competence and compliance.

**Refresher Trigger:** Event or timeframe requiring retraining (four universal triggers: annual calendar, role change, policy change, incident/audit finding; plus client-specific triggers needs\_review).

**Annual Refresher Cadence:** Training repeated every 12 months from initial completion date (universal baseline; client may require shorter intervals needs\_review).

**Role Change Trigger:** New or expanded job responsibilities requiring additional training modules.

**Policy Change Trigger:** Significant update to regulations, client policies, or Uplift procedures requiring retraining on affected content.

**Incident/Audit Finding Trigger:** Individual performance issue or audit gap requiring immediate targeted retraining.

**Client-Specific Refresher Cadence:** Shortened intervals required by specific clients (e.g., quarterly instead of annual; needs\_review for each client).

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Verify Training Record Completeness**

1. Complete all required course modules and assessments  
2. Receive training completion notification from learning management system  
3. Access your training record in system within 24 hours of completion  
4. Verify all required fields populated:  
   * Your name and employee ID correct  
   * Course name and number correct  
   * Completion date accurate  
   * Delivery mode documented  
   * Duration track documented  
   * All assessment scores recorded  
   * Attempt counts recorded (if multiple attempts occurred)  
   * Cooling periods documented (if applicable)  
   * Supervisor signature/approval present (electronic or manual)  
   * Refresher due date calculated and displayed  
5. If any field is missing or incorrect: report to training coordinator within 48 hours  
6. Print or save PDF copy of completed training record for personal records (optional but recommended)  
7. Note refresher due date in personal calendar with 30-day advance reminder

**Procedure: Track and Complete Refresher Training**

1. Identify applicable refresher triggers for your role:  
   * Annual trigger: 12 months from course completion date (or shorter per client needs\_review)  
   * Role change trigger: assignment to new responsibilities requiring additional training  
   * Policy change trigger: notification from compliance team of significant policy update  
   * Incident/audit trigger: notification from supervisor of required retraining  
2. When trigger occurs, verify refresher course assignment in learning management system  
3. If refresher not automatically assigned within 30 days of trigger: escalate to training coordinator  
4. Complete refresher training within assigned timeframe (typically 30 days for annual; 14 days for policy change; immediate for incident)  
5. Refresher completion generates new training record; verify fields as above  
6. New refresher due date calculated from refresher completion date

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if training record fields are incomplete — incomplete records fail audits  
* Stop if refresher due date is missing — cannot track compliance without date  
* Stop if refresher assignment is not received within expected timeframe — escalate immediately

**Escalation Path:** Training coordinator → Compliance lead → Client account manager (if client-specific issue)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* All training record fields completed per list above  
* Refresher completion documented separately from initial training (separate record)  
* Escalations regarding missing records or assignments documented in ticket system

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1:** Employee completes Course 1 on March 15, 2024\. Training record shows completion date 3/15/2024, all assessment scores, supervisor approval, and refresher due date 3/15/2025 (annual trigger). Employee sets calendar reminder for 2/15/2025 (30 days in advance). On 2/15/2025, checks for refresher assignment, completes refresher by 3/15/2025, new due date becomes 3/15/2026.

**Why Compliant:** Verified record completeness, tracked refresher proactively, completed within timeframe.

**Compliant Example 2:** Employee receives notification of policy change affecting Course 1 Module 7 (email hygiene). Compliance team assigns Module 7 refresher with 14-day deadline. Employee completes within 10 days. Refresher record generated separately from initial Course 1 record.

**Why Compliant:** Responded to policy change trigger, completed within required timeframe, separate record maintained.

**Non-Compliant Example:** Employee completes Course 1 but does not verify training record. Two months later, audit request requires proof of training. Training record is missing supervisor signature field. Employee cannot produce complete record, creates audit finding.

**Why Non-Compliant:** Failed to verify record completeness within 24-48 hours of completion; record incompleteness discovered only during audit.

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set (Required Training Record Fields Memorization \- 10 Repetitions):** Recite all required fields from memory:

1. Employee name  
2. Employee ID  
3. Course name/number  
4. Completion date  
5. Delivery mode  
6. Duration track  
7. Assessment scores  
8. Attempt counts  
9. Cooling periods (if applicable)  
10. Supervisor signature/approval  
11. Refresher due date

**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** You completed Course 3 on June 1, 2024\. Your client requires quarterly refreshers (every 3 months) for Course 3 instead of annual. Your training record shows refresher due date of June 1, 2025 (annual default). What is the error and what do you do?

**Answer:**  
 **Error:** Refresher due date calculated using annual default instead of client-specific quarterly requirement.  
 **Action:** Report discrepancy to training coordinator immediately. Request correction to September 1, 2024 (3 months from June 1, 2024). Set calendar reminder for August 1, 2024 to check for refresher assignment.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Training coordinator  
 **Learner plays:** Employee reviewing training record

**Trainer:** "I'm auditing your Course 1 record. Can you confirm all required fields are present?"

**Learner expected actions:**

* Access training record in system  
* Recite required fields list  
* Confirm each field is populated  
* Identify any missing or incorrect fields  
* If discrepancies found: report them during simulation  
* Show refresher due date and explain tracking method

**Checklist: Training Record Verification**

* \[ \] Employee name and ID correct  
* \[ \] Course name and number correct  
* \[ \] Completion date accurate  
* \[ \] Delivery mode documented  
* \[ \] Duration track documented  
* \[ \] All assessment scores recorded  
* \[ \] Attempt counts recorded (if applicable)  
* \[ \] Cooling periods documented (if applicable)  
* \[ \] Supervisor signature/approval present  
* \[ \] Refresher due date calculated and displayed  
* \[ \] Personal calendar reminder set for 30 days before due date  
* \[ \] Escalated any missing/incorrect fields within 48 hours

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Field identification: 6 points (11 fields, 0.5 points each, round up)  
* Verification process: 2 points  
* Refresher tracking: 2 points  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (12 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** How many required training record fields must be completed? A) 8  
 B) 10  
 C) 11  
 D) 15

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Source lists 11 required fields (name, ID, course, date, mode, track, scores, attempts, cooling periods, signature, refresher due date).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — missing one or two fields from count.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Annual refresher trigger means training repeats every: A) 6 months  
 B) 12 months  
 C) 18 months  
 D) 24 months

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Annual means every 12 months from completion date.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — confusing "annual" with "biennial."

**Item 3 (True/False):** Client-specific refresher cadence can require more frequent retraining than annual baseline.

**Answer:** True  
 **Rationale:** Source states client-specific cadence (needs\_review) may shorten intervals (e.g., quarterly).

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Which is NOT a universal refresher trigger? A) Annual calendar  
 B) Role change  
 C) Employee request  
 D) Policy change

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Four universal triggers are annual, role change, policy change, incident/audit. Employee request is not a trigger.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — policy change IS a trigger.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Your training record is missing supervisor signature. You discover this 3 months after course completion during an audit. What is the consequence? A) No consequence; signature is optional  
 B) Audit finding; incomplete record  
 C) You must retake the course  
 D) Supervisor is disciplined, not you

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Incomplete training records create audit findings; learner is responsible for verifying within 24-48 hours of completion.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — signature is required field, not optional.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** When should you verify your training record is complete? A) During the next audit  
 B) Within 24 hours of completion  
 C) When refresher is due  
 D) Only if requested by supervisor

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Procedure requires verification within 24 hours (48 hours maximum) of completion.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — waiting until audit is too late to correct.

**Item 7 (MCQ):** Incident/audit finding trigger requires retraining: A) Annually  
 B) Quarterly  
 C) Immediately  
 D) Within 30 days

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Incident/audit triggers require immediate targeted retraining.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — 30 days applies to annual refresher, not incident trigger.

**Item 8 (True/False):** Refresher training completion generates a new training record separate from the initial training record.

**Answer:** True  
 **Rationale:** Source states refresher completion creates separate record; initial record remains for audit trail.

**Item 9 (MCQ):** You are assigned to a new role requiring Course 2 (you have not taken Course 2 before). This is an example of which trigger? A) Annual trigger  
 B) Role change trigger  
 C) Policy change trigger  
 D) Incident trigger

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Role change trigger includes new responsibilities requiring additional training.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — annual trigger applies to courses already completed.

**Item 10 (Ordering):** Arrange these steps for refresher completion: A) Complete refresher → Verify new record → Set new calendar reminder → Identify trigger  
 B) Identify trigger → Complete refresher → Verify new record → Set new calendar reminder  
 C) Verify new record → Identify trigger → Complete refresher → Set new calendar reminder  
 D) Identify trigger → Set new calendar reminder → Complete refresher → Verify new record

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Logical sequence is trigger recognition → completion → verification → tracking.

**Item 11 (Short Answer):** Name the four universal refresher triggers.

**Answer:**

1. Annual calendar  
2. Role change  
3. Policy change  
4. Incident/audit finding

**Rationale:** Source lists these four plus client-specific as triggers.

**Item 12 (Scenario MCQ):** Your refresher is due March 1\. You receive the assignment February 15 with 30-day completion window. You are very busy. You complete it March 31\. What is the issue? A) No issue; completed within 30 days  
 B) Missed due date; should complete by March 1  
 C) Should request extension first  
 D) Supervisor should grant automatic extension

**Answer:** A  
 **Rationale:** 30-day completion window means 30 days from assignment (Feb 15), so deadline is March 17; March 31 is late. However, if "due date" means original trigger date (March 1\) and 30-day window starts from due date, then March 31 is within window. This is ambiguous; assuming 30-day window from assignment (Feb 15), March 31 is late.

**Corrected Answer: Scenario is ambiguous as written. If 30-day window starts from assignment date (Feb 15), deadline is March 17 and March 31 is late. If 30-day window starts from due date (March 1), deadline is March 31 and completion is on time. Best practice: complete before original due date (March 1\) when possible.**

For testing purposes:  
 **Revised Item 12 (Scenario MCQ):**  
 Your refresher is due March 1\. You receive the assignment February 15 with instruction to "complete by due date." You complete it March 5\. What is the issue? A) No issue if completed within 30 days of assignment  
 B) Missed due date of March 1  
 C) No due date applies to refreshers  
 D) Due date is flexible

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Instruction states "complete by due date" (March 1); March 5 is late.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — 30-day window does not override explicit "by due date" instruction.

### **MODULE 0.4: SANCTIONS PROCESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY (20 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Uplift enforces training and compliance standards through a four-level sanctions process: counseling, written warning, final warning, termination. Sanctions apply to training failures (missed deadlines, failed attempts, policy violations during training) and operational compliance failures (incidents, breaches, repeat errors). High-severity failures involving PHI exposure or compliance violations can accelerate directly to termination regardless of prior history (acceleration clause). Understanding sanctions motivates compliance and prevents career-ending mistakes.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Meets all training deadlines  
* Maintains passing standards on all assessments  
* Reports incidents and near-misses immediately  
* Cooperates with investigations  
* Does not retaliate against reporters  
* Understands which behaviors trigger which sanction levels

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Sanctions Process:** Progressive disciplinary framework with four escalating levels applied uniformly across all roles and tenure levels.

**First Occurrence \- Counseling:** Verbal or written counseling documenting the issue, expectations, and timeline for correction. No formal discipline on employment record but documented in training/compliance file.

**Second Occurrence \- Written Warning:** Formal written warning placed in employment file. Includes performance improvement plan with specific corrective actions and monitoring period (typically 30-60 days).

**Third Occurrence \- Final Warning:** Final written warning stating that any additional occurrence may result in termination. Monitoring period extended (typically 60-90 days). May include temporary restrictions on duties or access.

**Fourth Occurrence \- Termination:** Employment termination. Applies after exhausting three prior levels OR immediately under acceleration clause.

**Acceleration Clause:** High-severity failures involving PHI exposure, compliance violations, fraud, or intentional policy circumvention can skip directly to termination regardless of prior discipline history. Examples: creating fake training records, accessing patient records without authorization, sharing credentials, bypassing cooling periods through fraud, deleting evidence during investigations.

**Retaliation Prohibition:** Policy forbidding punishment, negative treatment, or discrimination against employees who report incidents, near-misses, policy violations, or compliance concerns. Retaliation itself triggers sanctions up to termination.

**Occurrence:** Single instance of training failure or compliance violation within a rolling 12-month window. Occurrences older than 12 months do not count toward progressive sanctions unless pattern demonstrates ongoing non-compliance.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Understand How Sanctions Apply**

1. Review categories of sanctionable conduct:  
   * Training failures: missed deadlines, failed all attempts without completion, non-participation in required training  
   * Assessment integrity violations: cheating, having someone else take assessment, sharing answers  
   * Operational compliance failures: policy violations, incidents caused by negligence, repeat errors after training  
   * High-severity violations: PHI breaches, fraud, credential sharing, evidence tampering  
2. When any occurrence happens, expect supervisor notification within 5 business days  
3. Supervisor meeting will review:  
   * What happened (facts)  
   * Which policy/requirement was violated  
   * Sanction level applied based on occurrence count and severity  
   * Corrective actions required  
   * Timeline for completion  
   * Consequences of additional occurrences  
4. Sign acknowledgment of sanction (signature confirms receipt, not agreement)  
5. Complete corrective actions within specified timeline  
6. Document completion and submit to supervisor  
7. If occurrence qualifies for acceleration clause: expect immediate termination discussion; HR will be present

**Procedure: Report Without Fear of Retaliation**

1. Identify reportable concern (incident, near-miss, policy violation, unsafe practice)  
2. Report immediately through proper channel:  
   * Supervisor (first line)  
   * Compliance hotline (if supervisor is involved or unresponsive)  
   * HR (if retaliation concern exists)  
3. Provide factual description without speculation  
4. If you experience negative treatment after reporting:  
   * Document specific instances (dates, actions, witnesses)  
   * Report retaliation to HR immediately  
   * Retaliation investigation will be conducted separately  
5. Continue performing job duties professionally during any investigation

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if asked to falsify training records — report immediately; participation triggers termination  
* Stop if pressured to skip training or assessments — escalate to compliance  
* Stop if threatened for reporting concerns — document and escalate to HR

**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → HR → Compliance lead → Legal (for retaliation or high-severity violations)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* All sanctions documented in employee file with occurrence date, level, corrective actions, and completion status  
* Retaliation complaints investigated and documented separately  
* Acceleration clause invocations require written justification from compliance lead

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1:** Employee misses Course 1 completion deadline due to unforeseen personal emergency. Notifies supervisor before deadline with documentation. Receives counseling (first occurrence) with extended deadline. Completes within extended timeline. No further occurrences in 12 months. After 12 months, occurrence no longer counts toward progressive discipline.

**Why Compliant:** Proactive communication, accepted accountability, completed corrective action, clean record after rolling 12-month period.

**Compliant Example 2:** Employee witnesses colleague accessing records without authorization (curiosity browsing). Reports to supervisor immediately. Investigation confirms violation. Colleague receives sanctions (potentially acceleration to termination depending on severity). Reporting employee experiences no negative consequences; retaliation prohibition protects reporter.

**Why Compliant:** Immediate reporting of serious violation, cooperation with investigation, reporter protected.

**Non-Compliant Example:** Employee fails Course 1 after exhausting all attempts and cooling period. Instead of completing remediation and retest, creates new user account to take assessment under different name and passes. Fraud is discovered during routine audit. Immediate termination under acceleration clause (fraud/circumvention of controls).

**Why Non-Compliant:** Intentional circumvention of policy, fraud, assessment integrity violation. Acceleration clause applies regardless of no prior discipline history.

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set (Sanction Level Matching \- 10 Scenarios):**

1. First missed training deadline with valid reason → Counseling  
2. Second failed practical after remediation → Written Warning  
3. Accessing celebrity patient record out of curiosity → Termination (acceleration clause)  
4. Third occurrence of incomplete documentation → Final Warning  
5. Sharing password with colleague to meet deadline → Termination (acceleration clause)  
6. Fourth occurrence of late status updates → Termination (progressive)  
7. Deleting incident evidence after being told to preserve → Termination (acceleration clause)  
8. First occurrence of verification script abandonment → Counseling  
9. Creating fake training completion certificate → Termination (acceleration clause)  
10. Second occurrence of using unapproved communication channel → Written Warning

**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** You receive written warning (second occurrence) for missing Course 2 deadline. Three weeks later, you accidentally send PHI to wrong recipient via approved channel, immediately report incident, preserve evidence, and cooperate fully with investigation. Investigation finds no negligence; was honest mistake. What sanction level applies?

**Answer:**  
 Depends on investigation findings. If truly accidental with proper immediate response and no negligence pattern, may receive counseling or written warning (third occurrence) rather than termination. However, if PHI exposure was due to not following trained procedures (e.g., skipping recipient verification from Module 7), could be treated as higher severity with potential for final warning (third occurrence) or acceleration consideration if exposure was significant. Immediate reporting and evidence preservation are mitigating factors.

**Best Answer:** Third occurrence \= Final Warning, given immediate reporting and cooperation. Acceleration unlikely if procedures were followed and error was truly inadvertent.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Supervisor conducting sanctions meeting  
 **Learner plays:** Employee receiving written warning (second occurrence)

**Trainer:** "This is your second occurrence in six months. Last time was counseling for missed deadline. This time you failed Module 8 phishing simulation after remediation. This is a written warning. Here's your performance improvement plan. You have 30 days to complete Module 8 refresher and pass simulation at 90%. Any additional training or compliance failures in the next 12 months will result in final warning or termination depending on severity. Do you understand?"

**Learner expected actions:**

* Listen without interrupting  
* Ask clarifying questions about corrective actions  
* Confirm timeline (30 days)  
* Acknowledge consequence of additional occurrences  
* Sign acknowledgment form  
* Do NOT argue or make excuses during meeting (can provide context, but accept accountability)  
* Schedule Module 8 refresher immediately after meeting

**Checklist: Sanctions Awareness**

* \[ \] Understand four sanction levels (counseling, written warning, final warning, termination)  
* \[ \] Understand acceleration clause triggers (PHI exposure, fraud, circumvention)  
* \[ \] Understand 12-month rolling window for occurrence counting  
* \[ \] Understand retaliation prohibition protects reporters  
* \[ \] Know escalation path for reporting concerns  
* \[ \] Know escalation path for retaliation complaints  
* \[ \] Understand sanctions apply regardless of role or tenure  
* \[ \] Understand corrective actions must be completed within timeline

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Sanction level identification: 3 points  
* Acceleration clause understanding: 2 points  
* Retaliation prohibition: 2 points  
* Occurrence counting: 2 points  
* Reporting procedures: 1 point  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (12 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** How many sanction levels exist in the progressive discipline framework? A) 3  
 B) 4  
 C) 5  
 D) Varies by role

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Four levels: counseling, written warning, final warning, termination.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — including "verbal warning" as separate from counseling.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Acceleration clause allows skipping directly to which level? A) Written warning  
 B) Final warning  
 C) Termination  
 D) Probation

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** High-severity violations can accelerate directly to termination regardless of prior history.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — final warning is still progressive, not acceleration.

**Item 3 (True/False):** Sanctions apply differently based on how long you have worked at Uplift.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Source states sanctions apply regardless of role or tenure; uniform application.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — believing tenure provides protection.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Which is an example of acceleration clause violation? A) Missing training deadline  
 B) Failing assessment twice  
 C) Sharing your password with colleague  
 D) Requesting deadline extension

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Credential sharing is high-severity compliance violation triggering acceleration.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — failing assessments is progressive, not acceleration (unless fraud involved).

**Item 5 (MCQ):** Retaliation prohibition protects employees who: A) Fail training repeatedly  
 B) Report incidents and compliance concerns  
 C) Violate policies  
 D) Miss deadlines

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Retaliation prohibition protects reporters of incidents, near-misses, and compliance concerns.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — policy violations are not protected conduct.

**Item 6 (Scenario MCQ):** You received counseling 14 months ago for late documentation. Today you miss a training deadline. What sanction level applies? A) Counseling (first occurrence)  
 B) Written warning (second occurrence)  
 C) Final warning  
 D) Termination

**Answer:** A  
 **Rationale:** 12-month rolling window means 14-month-old occurrence no longer counts; today's is first occurrence.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — not understanding rolling window resets occurrence count.

**Item 7 (MCQ):** During sanctions meeting, you should: A) Argue why the sanction is unfair  
 B) Listen, ask clarifying questions, sign acknowledgment  
 C) Refuse to sign until you consult a lawyer  
 D) Demand to speak to HR immediately

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Professional response is to listen, clarify, acknowledge receipt (signature is not agreement with sanction).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — signature confirms receipt, not agreement; refusal does not prevent sanction.

**Item 8 (True/False):** If you report an incident, your supervisor can give you a poor performance review as punishment.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Retaliation prohibition forbids negative treatment for reporting.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — not understanding retaliation protection scope.

**Item 9 (MCQ):** Third occurrence in the progressive framework results in: A) Counseling  
 B) Written warning  
 C) Final warning  
 D) Termination

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Progressive sequence is counseling → written warning → final warning → termination.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Which action does NOT trigger acceleration clause? A) Deleting incident emails  
 B) Accessing records without authorization  
 C) Failing refresher training after three attempts  
 D) Creating fake training certificates

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Failing assessments is progressive discipline; others are fraud/high-severity.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — unauthorized access triggers acceleration.

**Item 11 (Short Answer):** You witness a colleague bypassing verification steps under pressure. What are your two immediate actions?

**Answer:**

1. Report to supervisor immediately  
2. Do not confront colleague directly; allow investigation process

**Rationale:** Immediate reporting is required; direct confrontation may compromise investigation or create conflict.

**Item 12 (Scenario MCQ):** You receive final warning (third occurrence). One month later, you have a minor incident (sent email with wrong subject line format, immediately corrected). What is the likely consequence? A) Verbal reminder, no formal sanction  
 B) Additional counseling  
 C) Termination (fourth occurrence)  
 D) Final warning extended

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Fourth occurrence after final warning typically results in termination per progressive framework.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — final warning status means any additional occurrence may result in termination; severity is evaluated but fourth occurrence is termination unless investigation finds no policy violation.

### **MODULE 0.5: CORE DEFINITIONS (PHI, ePHI, MINIMUM NECESSARY, INCIDENT, BREACH) (30 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Five core definitions underpin all six courses: PHI (protected health information \= identifiers \+ health/payment context), ePHI (electronic PHI), Minimum Necessary (use/disclose only what's needed for the task), Incident (any policy violation or risk event including near-misses), Breach (incident involving unsecured PHI posing significant risk, determined by privacy officer). Precise definitions prevent confusion and ensure consistent application across all training.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Correctly identifies PHI in mixed content  
* Distinguishes ePHI from paper PHI in handling decisions  
* Applies Minimum Necessary before sharing or documenting  
* Recognizes incidents even when no harm occurred  
* Does not self-determine breach status; escalates for determination

#### **2\) Definitions**

**PHI (Protected Health Information):** Information (oral, written, or electronic) that:

1. Identifies or can identify an individual (contains direct or indirect identifiers such as name, MRN, account number, contact info, dates tied to care, etc.), AND  
2. Relates to individual's health condition, healthcare provision, or healthcare payment

**Examples of PHI:**

* Patient name \+ diagnosis  
* Account number \+ appointment reason  
* Photo containing patient \+ clinic location  
* Email address \+ claim number  
* Voicemail containing patient name \+ test results

**Direct Identifiers:** Name, MRN, SSN, account number, phone number, email, address, photo, biometrics, IP address, device IDs.

**Indirect Identifiers:** Age (if rare), dates (birth, admission, discharge, death if tied to care), geographic subdivisions smaller than state (if population \< 20,000).

**ePHI (Electronic Protected Health Information):** PHI in electronic form, including information created, stored, transmitted, or received electronically. Includes data in computer systems, emails, text messages, portal messages, scanned documents, digital photos, databases, electronic health records.

**Distinction from paper PHI:** ePHI requires specific technical safeguards (encryption, access controls, audit logs) in addition to physical safeguards. Handling procedures may differ (e.g., secure deletion vs shredding).

**Minimum Necessary Standard:** Requirement to use, disclose, and request only the minimum amount of PHI reasonably needed to accomplish the intended purpose. Applies to:

* Documentation (include only necessary identifiers and details)  
* Communication (share only what recipient needs for their role)  
* Access requests (request only necessary permissions)

**Does NOT apply to:**

* Treatment activities (providers may access all relevant PHI for treatment)  
* Disclosures to patient themselves or their authorized representative  
* Disclosures required by law

**Incident:** Any use, access, or disclosure of PHI that violates policy or creates risk, including near-misses (events that could have resulted in violation but were caught/stopped in time). Examples:

* Wrong recipient email (sent or caught before sending)  
* Unauthorized access to records  
* Lost/stolen device with PHI  
* Verification failure followed by disclosure  
* Workstation left unlocked in presence of unauthorized person  
* Unapproved channel usage

**Key principle:** Incidents include near-misses; do not wait for harm to occur before reporting.

**Breach:** An incident involving the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of unsecured PHI that poses a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual, as determined by the client's privacy officer (not by staff member). Requires specific notification procedures including patient notification, regulatory reporting, and potential public disclosure depending on scope.

**Key principle:** Staff report incidents; privacy officer determines if incident rises to breach level. Staff never self-determine breach status.

**Unsecured PHI:** PHI not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized persons through encryption or destruction per federal standards. (Needs\_review for specific client encryption requirements and safe harbor standards.)

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Identify PHI in Mixed Content**

1. Examine content (document, email, screen, conversation)  
2. Scan for identifiers:  
   * Names (patient, guarantor, family member if linked to patient)  
   * Numbers (MRN, account, claim, SSN, phone, insurance ID)  
   * Contact info (email, address)  
   * Dates tied to care or payment (appointment, admission, DOB, etc.)  
   * Photos or other identifying media  
3. Scan for health or payment context:  
   * Diagnosis, symptoms, treatment  
   * Medications, test results, procedures  
   * Claim status, payment, billing  
   * Insurance coverage, benefits  
4. If BOTH identifier AND health/payment context present: treat as PHI  
5. If identifier only (no health/payment context): still sensitive but may not be PHI (e.g., patient name in directory without medical context)  
6. If health/payment context only (no identifier): may be sensitive but not PHI (e.g., "patient with diabetes" in training without any identifiers)  
7. When uncertain: treat as PHI and escalate for confirmation

**Procedure: Apply Minimum Necessary Standard**

1. Identify purpose of use, disclosure, or access  
2. Ask: "What is the minimum information needed to accomplish this specific purpose?"  
3. Remove or redact:  
   * Unnecessary identifiers (e.g., if account number suffices, remove name)  
   * Unnecessary clinical details (e.g., if verifying eligibility, omit diagnosis)  
   * Unnecessary dates or contacts  
4. Document using generic terms where possible (e.g., "pt" instead of full name in operational notes)  
5. When communicating, confirm recipient's need-to-know before sharing  
6. If unable to determine minimum necessary: escalate to supervisor with proposed scope

**Procedure: Recognize and Report Incidents**

1. Observe or become aware of potential policy violation or risk event  
2. Ask: "Did this involve PHI? Was policy followed correctly? Was there risk of unauthorized access/disclosure?"  
3. If yes to any question: treat as incident  
4. Include near-misses: "Almost sent to wrong recipient" is reportable incident  
5. Report immediately using incident reporting procedure (Module 10\)  
6. Do NOT self-assess whether incident is a breach  
7. Cooperate with investigation  
8. If you caused the incident: report anyway (self-reporting is protected and expected)

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if uncertain whether content contains PHI — treat as PHI until confirmed otherwise  
* Stop if uncertain about Minimum Necessary scope — escalate before disclosing  
* Stop if incident occurs — report immediately before continuing work

**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → Privacy officer (for breach determination) → Compliance lead

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Incident reports document: what happened, when, who was involved, what PHI was involved, immediate actions taken  
* Privacy officer documents breach determination with risk assessment

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- PHI Identification:** Email contains: "Claim 123456 for J. Smith \- authorization approved for MRI." Content has identifier (claim number \+ name) \+ payment context (authorization). Correctly identified as PHI. Employee applies Minimum Necessary when forwarding: removes name, keeps claim number only, subject line generic ("Claim status update").

**Why Compliant:** Accurate PHI identification, Minimum Necessary applied proactively.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Incident Reporting:** Employee composes email to payer, types recipient email address, auto-complete suggests similar address, employee notices wrong recipient before sending, deletes draft. Employee reports as near-miss incident: "Almost sent PHI to wrong recipient, caught during address verification, no disclosure occurred."

**Why Compliant:** Near-miss reported even though no disclosure occurred; demonstrates incident awareness.

**Non-Compliant Example:** Employee sends PHI to wrong recipient (auto-complete error). Employee realizes mistake, recalls email (recall fails), deletes sent email from own mailbox. Employee does not report incident, reasoning "I fixed it so no harm done." Three days later, recipient reports receiving PHI not intended for them. Investigation discovers employee's failure to report and evidence deletion (deleted sent email).

**Why Non-Compliant:** Multiple violations: failure to report incident immediately, evidence destruction, self-determination that "no harm" means no reporting needed. Results in sanctions (potentially acceleration clause for evidence destruction).

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set (PHI Identification \- 15 Items):**

Identify which items contain PHI:

1. "Patient John Doe scheduled for surgery tomorrow" → PHI (name \+ treatment context)  
2. "Account 789 has outstanding balance" → PHI (account identifier \+ payment context)  
3. "Diabetes training seminar for staff" → Not PHI (no identifier)  
4. "MRN 456789 \- discharge summary attached" → PHI (MRN \+ treatment context)  
5. "The clinic is open Monday-Friday" → Not PHI (no identifier, no health context)  
6. "555-1234 called about medication refill" → PHI (phone number identifier \+ treatment context)  
7. "Patient in Room 5 needs assistance" → Ambiguous; in context may be PHI if identifiable (treat as PHI)  
8. Screenshot of EHR with patient name visible → PHI (identifier \+ interface implies health context)  
9. "Our hospital treats cancer patients" → Not PHI (general statement, no identifier)  
10. Email address "jsmith@email.com mentioned in claim" → PHI (email identifier \+ payment context)  
11. "Sarah, DOB 3/15/1980, requesting records" → PHI (name \+ DOB \+ health records context)  
12. "Benefits verification tool is down" → Not PHI (system status, no identifier)  
13. Sticky note: "Call Mrs. Johnson re: test results" → PHI (name \+ test results context)  
14. "Patient reported chest pain during visit" in deidentified case study → Not PHI if properly deidentified (no identifier present)  
15. Calendar entry: "Meeting with Smith family \- care planning" → PHI (family name \+ care context)

**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** You are documenting a call in ticketing system. You need to reference the patient's account for continuity. The ticket template has fields for: Account Number, Name, DOB, Issue Description, Resolution, Follow-up. The issue is "patient requested payment plan options." You resolved by sending payment plan brochure link.

**Question:** Which fields must you complete, applying Minimum Necessary?

**Answer:**

* Account Number: YES (needed for record continuity)  
* Name: NO (account number is sufficient identifier)  
* DOB: NO (not needed for payment plan inquiry)  
* Issue Description: YES ("Payment plan options requested" \- minimal necessary)  
* Resolution: YES ("Payment plan brochure sent via approved portal link")  
* Follow-up: YES if applicable ("Follow-up in 14 days if no response")

**Minimum Necessary Applied:** Used account number (necessary), omitted name and DOB (unnecessary duplication of identifiers), described issue and resolution without extra PHI.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Supervisor asking about email content  
 **Learner plays:** Employee who needs to forward information

**Trainer:** "You need to forward claim status to the billing team. The original email has patient name, MRN, claim number, diagnosis, and payment amount. What do you include in your forward?"

**Learner expected actions:**

* State purpose: billing team needs claim status  
* Identify minimum necessary: claim number \+ payment amount (billing context)  
* State what to remove: patient name, MRN, diagnosis (unnecessary for billing team's specific task)  
* Demonstrate forwarding with only claim number and payment amount  
* Confirm recipient is billing team (need-to-know verified)

**Checklist: Core Definitions Application**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (15 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** PHI requires which two elements? A) Identifier \+ location  
 B) Identifier \+ health/payment context  
 C) Health context \+ date  
 D) Electronic format \+ security

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** PHI \= identifier \+ health/payment context per definition.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — missing identifier element.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Which is NOT PHI? A) Patient name \+ diagnosis  
 B) Account number \+ claim status  
 C) "Diabetes education class schedule"  
 D) MRN \+ medication list

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** No identifier present in general class schedule.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — MRN \+ medication is clearly PHI.

**Item 3 (True/False):** ePHI and paper PHI have identical handling requirements.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** ePHI requires additional technical safeguards (encryption, access logs); paper requires physical safeguards (locked storage, shredding).

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Minimum Necessary does NOT apply to: A) Documentation  
 B) Treatment activities  
 C) Communication with colleagues  
 D) Access requests

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Treatment activities exempt from Minimum Necessary; providers may access all relevant PHI for treatment.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — access requests DO require Minimum Necessary.

**Item 5 (MCQ):** An incident includes: A) Only events where harm occurred  
 B) Only events where PHI was disclosed  
 C) Any violation or risk event including near-misses  
 D) Only breaches

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Incidents include near-misses and any policy violation/risk event.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — harm is not required for incident classification.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Who determines if an incident is a breach? A) The employee who caused it  
 B) The supervisor  
 C) The privacy officer  
 D) The compliance committee

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Privacy officer conducts risk assessment and determines breach status.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — supervisor receives report but does not determine breach.

**Item 7 (Scenario MCQ):** You write a note: "Pt called re: balance inquiry. Explained statement. F/U if needed." Does this contain PHI? A) No, no identifiers present  
 B) Yes, "pt" is identifier  
 C) Ambiguous, depends on system context  
 D) Only if note includes account number

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** If note is filed under patient account in system, "pt" in context identifies individual \+ payment context \= PHI. Outside system context without linkage, may not be PHI.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — missing system context consideration.

**Item 8 (True/False):** If you catch a mistake before PHI is disclosed (near-miss), you do not need to report it as an incident.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Near-misses are reportable incidents; demonstrates risk awareness.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — "no harm \= no report" misconception.

**Item 9 (MCQ):** Minimum Necessary means: A) Use the smallest font size  
 B) Disclose only what's needed for the purpose  
 C) Always use account numbers instead of names  
 D) Limit access to supervisors only

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Minimum Necessary \= only disclose/use/request what's needed for specific purpose.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — account numbers are not always "less" than names; depends on purpose.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Which is ePHI? A) Paper chart in file cabinet  
 B) Verbal conversation in hallway  
 C) Email containing patient name and diagnosis  
 D) Handwritten note on clipboard

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Email is electronic format; contains identifier \+ health context \= ePHI.

**Item 11 (Scenario MCQ):** You need to route a ticket to another pod. Ticket contains name, MRN, phone, DOB, diagnosis, and issue description ("needs prior auth for MRI"). What do you include in routing message applying Minimum Necessary? A) All fields to give complete picture  
 B) Account number \+ issue description only  
 C) Name \+ diagnosis \+ issue  
 D) MRN \+ issue description only

**Answer:** D  
 **Rationale:** MRN identifies patient (necessary for routing), issue description (necessary for action). Other fields unnecessary for routing purpose.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — violates Minimum Necessary by including all fields.

**Item 12 (True/False):** "Unsecured PHI" means PHI not encrypted or destroyed per federal standards.

**Answer:** True  
 **Rationale:** Definition of unsecured PHI requires encryption/destruction to render unusable.

**Item 13 (MCQ):** You accidentally access a patient record without authorization (curiosity browsing). You immediately close the record and do nothing else. What is this? A) Not an incident because you closed it quickly  
 B) An incident requiring immediate reporting  
 C) A breach requiring patient notification  
 D) Acceptable if you don't tell anyone

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Unauthorized access is an incident requiring immediate reporting regardless of duration.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "quick" does not excuse unauthorized access.

**Item 14 (Short Answer):** Define PHI in one sentence using both required elements.

**Answer:** PHI is information that identifies or can identify an individual AND relates to the individual's health condition, healthcare provision, or healthcare payment.

**Rationale:** Must include both identifier and health/payment context.

**Item 15 (MCQ):** Which statement about breach determination is correct? A) Employees determine breach status based on severity  
 B) Privacy officer determines breach status after risk assessment  
 C) All incidents are automatically breaches  
 D) Only incidents with patient complaints are breaches

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Privacy officer conducts formal risk assessment to determine breach status.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — not all incidents are breaches; requires significant risk determination.

### **MODULE 0.6: ENTRY-LEVEL SCAFFOLDING AND SAFE STOP RULES (30 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** This module equips new learners with navigation skills: how to read modules, use job aids, complete assessments, and apply five universal safe stop rules that always override other instructions: (1) Stop if identity not verified, (2) Stop if channel not approved, (3) Stop if request purpose unclear, (4) Stop if rushed/pressured to bypass steps, (5) Escalate with minimal necessary context. These rules prevent the most common incident patterns.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Navigates learning system efficiently  
* Uses job aids to support task performance  
* Completes assessments without integrity violations  
* Applies safe stop rules reflexively when triggers occur  
* Escalates appropriately without over-disclosing PHI

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Module:** Self-contained learning unit covering one topic with primer, procedures, examples, practice, and assessment.

**Job Aid:** Reference document (checklist, script, template, flowchart) used during work performance to support consistent execution without memorization. Stored in accessible location for just-in-time use.

**Assessment:** Knowledge check or practical evaluation measuring competence, with defined passing standard and attempt limits.

**Safe Stop Rule:** Mandatory halt condition requiring immediate stop of current action, assessment of situation, and escalation if needed. Safe stop rules always override conflicting instructions, including from supervisors or clients.

**Identity Verification Requirement:** Confirmation of requester identity using approved factors before disclosing PHI or granting access.

**Approved Channel:** Communication or storage method explicitly allowed by client policy for PHI handling (needs\_review for client-specific channel lists).

**Request Purpose Clarity:** Understanding and documenting why PHI is being requested, disclosed, or accessed.

**Pressure to Bypass:** Urgency or coercion to skip verification, documentation, or other controls.

**Minimal Necessary Context During Escalation:** Sharing only non-PHI or minimum PHI required to escalate the issue (e.g., "I have a caller who cannot verify identity" rather than "John Smith at 555-1234 is asking for results").

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Navigate and Complete Training Modules**

1. Log into learning management system with credentials  
2. Access assigned course from dashboard  
3. For each module:  
   * Read entry-level primer first (plain language overview)  
   * Study definitions section (terms you will use)  
   * Read step-by-step procedures carefully (these are your work instructions)  
   * Review worked examples (see correct vs incorrect application)  
   * Complete practice pack activities (drills, scenarios, simulations)  
   * Take knowledge check when ready (review passing standard and attempt limits first)  
4. After passing knowledge check: system marks module complete automatically  
5. Proceed to next module only after current module marked complete  
6. Access job aids referenced in modules (stored in shared drive or LMS resource library)  
7. Bookmark or download job aids for use during actual work performance

**Procedure: Use Job Aids Effectively**

1. Identify job aid needed for task (e.g., verification script, phishing checklist, redaction template)  
2. Access job aid from designated storage location  
3. Follow job aid step-by-step during task performance (job aids are designed for real-time use, not memorization)  
4. Check off steps if job aid has checklist format  
5. Document use of job aid if required by task (e.g., "Used verification script per job aid")  
6. If job aid is unclear or seems outdated: escalate to supervisor; do not improvise

**Procedure: Apply Safe Stop Rules**

**Safe Stop Rule 1: Stop if Identity Not Verified**

* Before disclosing PHI, granting access, or processing requests: verify requester identity  
* Use approved verification method (Module 4 will detail methods)  
* If verification fails or cannot be completed: stop, do not disclose, offer alternative (e.g., secure callback, written request)  
* Document verification attempt outcome

**Safe Stop Rule 2: Stop if Channel Not Approved**

* Before sending, storing, or discussing PHI: confirm channel is approved for client  
* Approved channel list is client-specific (needs\_review; Module 7 will detail)  
* If uncertain whether channel is approved: stop, escalate to supervisor  
* Never use personal email, SMS, WhatsApp, or social media for PHI regardless of encryption

**Safe Stop Rule 3: Stop if Request Purpose Unclear**

* Before disclosing PHI: understand and document why information is needed  
* If requester cannot or will not state clear purpose: stop, do not disclose  
* "Just checking" or "general inquiry" is not sufficient purpose  
* Document unclear purpose and escalate

**Safe Stop Rule 4: Stop if Rushed or Pressured to Bypass Steps**

* If requester or supervisor pressures you to skip verification, documentation, or other controls: stop  
* State: "I need to follow the required procedure for compliance. This will take \[X minutes\]."  
* If pressure continues: stop interaction, escalate to compliance immediately  
* Document pressure attempt (who, when, what was requested)

**Safe Stop Rule 5: Escalate with Minimal Necessary Context**

* When escalating any issue: share only what supervisor needs to provide guidance  
* Avoid using patient names, diagnoses, or other identifiers in escalation message unless essential  
* Example escalation: "I have a caller requesting test results but cannot verify identity using our script. How should I proceed?" (no patient identifiers needed)  
* If PHI must be mentioned: use secure escalation channel (in-person, secure messaging, not hallway conversation)

**Safe Stop Decision Tree:**

1. Does situation involve PHI? (Yes → continue to step 2\)  
2. Is identity verified? (No → STOP, apply Rule 1\)  
3. Is channel approved? (No → STOP, apply Rule 2\)  
4. Is purpose clear? (No → STOP, apply Rule 3\)  
5. Am I being rushed/pressured? (Yes → STOP, apply Rule 4\)  
6. If any uncertainty remains → STOP, apply Rule 5 (escalate with minimal context)

**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → Compliance lead → Privacy officer (for PHI-related safe stops)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Safe stop trigger documented in incident report or task note  
* Escalation documented with timestamp and decision outcome  
* No PHI in escalation documentation unless secure method used

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- Safe Stop Rule 1 (Identity):** Caller requests test results. Employee begins verification script. Caller provides name but incorrect DOB. Employee tries DOB twice more (per script, three attempts allowed). All fail. Employee stops: "I'm unable to verify your identity over the phone. I can send you a secure portal message with instructions to access results online, or you can visit the clinic with photo ID." No results disclosed.

**Why Compliant:** Applied Rule 1, stopped when verification failed, offered secure alternative, documented failure.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Safe Stop Rule 4 (Pressure):** Supervisor urgently requests patient payment history "right now for a call." Supervisor says "skip the access request form, just pull it quickly." Employee stops: "I need to complete the access request form per procedure. It will take 2 minutes." Supervisor insists. Employee stops interaction: "I need to follow compliance procedure. Let me complete the form and I'll have the information to you in 5 minutes." Completes form, documents pressure attempt in note, provides information through proper channel.

**Why Compliant:** Applied Rule 4, did not bypass procedure despite pressure, documented incident (pressure to bypass controls).

**Non-Compliant Example:** Employee receives email request for patient records from external email address claiming to be "Dr. Smith from Cardiology Associates." Email looks professional. Employee is busy and email seems legitimate. Employee attaches records and sends without verifying requester identity through approved method. Email address was spoofed; PHI sent to wrong person. Breach occurs.

**Why Non-Compliant:** Failed to apply Rule 1 (verify identity) and Rule 2 (email verification process is required before external disclosure). Result: breach, sanctions, potential termination under acceleration clause if deemed reckless.

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set (Safe Stop Rule Matching \- 10 Scenarios):**

Match scenario to correct safe stop rule:

1. Caller cannot provide DOB after three attempts → Rule 1 (Identity)  
2. Asked to send PHI via WhatsApp → Rule 2 (Channel)  
3. Request for "general information about patient" → Rule 3 (Purpose)  
4. Supervisor says "skip verification, it's urgent" → Rule 4 (Pressure)  
5. Need help with complex disclosure decision → Rule 5 (Escalate)  
6. Email from unknown external address requesting records → Rule 1 (Identity) \+ Rule 2 (Channel)  
7. Family member "just wants to know if patient is okay" → Rule 3 (Purpose) \+ Rule 1 (Identity)  
8. Client asks you to "just look up neighbor's diagnosis quickly" → Rule 1 (Identity \- not verified as having access need) \+ Rule 3 (Purpose)  
9. Uncertain if Teams is approved for this client → Rule 2 (Channel)  
10. Colleague says "hurry up, just give me the password" → Rule 4 (Pressure) \+ other policy violations

**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** You receive a call. Caller says: "This is Dr. Johnson's office calling about the MRI authorization for our mutual patient Sarah Lee, DOB 3/15/1980. We need the status right away because she's scheduled tomorrow morning. Can you just tell me quickly if it's approved?"

**Question:** Which safe stop rules apply and what is your response?

**Answer:**

* **Rule 1 (Identity):** Caller identity not verified using approved method (Module 4 will detail verification for provider calls). Must verify caller is actually from Dr. Johnson's office.  
* **Rule 3 (Purpose):** Purpose stated (authorization status) but must confirm this is valid TPO disclosure per Module 2 framework.  
* **Rule 4 (Pressure):** "Right away," "quickly," "scheduled tomorrow" creates urgency pressure.

**Response:** "I need to verify your identity first using our provider verification process. This will take about 2-3 minutes. May I have the office phone number so I can call back to confirm?" OR "I need to verify you are calling from Dr. Johnson's office. Can you provide \[approved verification factors per client policy needs\_review\]?"

If verification succeeds and disclosure is permitted: provide authorization status. If verification fails: offer to send status via secure provider portal or fax to verified number. Document verification outcome and disclosure decision.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Caller requesting information  
 **Learner plays:** Employee handling request

**Round 1 \- Rule 1 Trigger:**  
 **Trainer:** "Hi, this is John Smith. I need my wife's test results. We share everything."

**Learner expected actions:**

* Request verification factors (name, DOB, last-four SSN per client script needs\_review)  
* If "John Smith" cannot verify as patient or authorized representative: STOP  
* Respond: "I'm unable to verify your authorization to receive this information. I can send a secure message to the patient with instructions to share the results with you, or the patient can call us directly."  
* Document: refused disclosure due to verification failure

**Round 2 \- Rule 2 Trigger:**  
 **Trainer:** "Can you just text me the results at this number?"

**Learner expected actions:**

* STOP  
* Respond: "Text message is not an approved channel for test results. I can send results via secure patient portal, or you can receive them during an office visit."  
* Document: offered approved alternatives

**Round 3 \- Rule 4 Trigger:**  
 **Trainer:** "I'm in the ER right now and the doctor needs this immediately\! Don't make me wait for your procedures\!"

**Learner expected actions:**

* STOP  
* Respond calmly: "I understand the urgency. I need to follow verification procedures to protect your information. This will take 2-3 minutes. Let's start with your date of birth."  
* If caller refuses verification: "I'm unable to proceed without verification. If you're in the ER, the ER physician can request records through the provider channel, which may be faster."  
* Document: attempted disclosure under pressure, maintained verification requirement

**Checklist: Safe Stop Rules Readiness**

* \[ \] Can list all five safe stop rules from memory  
* \[ \] Can identify safe stop triggers in scenarios  
* \[ \] Knows how to respond when safe stop triggered (stop, assess, escalate or use approved alternative)  
* \[ \] Understands safe stop rules override other instructions  
* \[ \] Knows escalation path for safe stop situations  
* \[ \] Can escalate with minimal necessary context (Rule 5\)  
* \[ \] Understands documentation requirements for safe stops

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Safe stop rule identification: 5 points (one per rule)  
* Scenario application: 3 points  
* Escalation procedure: 2 points  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (15 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** How many safe stop rules exist? A) 3  
 B) 4  
 C) 5  
 D) 7

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Five safe stop rules: identity, channel, purpose, pressure, escalate.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Safe stop rules: A) Are suggestions for best practice  
 B) Can be overridden by supervisors if urgent  
 C) Always apply and override conflicting instructions  
 D) Only apply during training

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Safe stop rules are mandatory and override conflicting instructions including from supervisors.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — urgency does not override safe stop rules.

**Item 3 (True/False):** If a caller cannot verify identity, you can disclose PHI if they sound legitimate.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Rule 1 requires identity verification; "sounds legitimate" is not verification.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — relying on judgment instead of verification procedure.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Which is an example of Rule 2 (approved channel) violation? A) Calling patient at verified phone number  
 B) Sending PHI via WhatsApp  
 C) Using secure patient portal  
 D) Faxing to verified fax number

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** WhatsApp is banned channel regardless of encryption.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — fax to verified number is typically approved (needs\_review per client).

**Item 5 (MCQ):** "I just want to check on my neighbor" is an example of which safe stop trigger? A) Identity not verified  
 B) Channel not approved  
 C) Purpose unclear  
 D) Pressure to bypass

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** "Just checking" is insufficient purpose; also identity/authorization issue.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — while also an identity issue, the primary trigger here is unclear purpose.

**Item 6 (Scenario MCQ):** Your supervisor says "I need this patient file immediately, don't bother with the access request form." What do you do? A) Follow supervisor's instruction to save time  
 B) Apply Rule 4, complete the form, document the pressure  
 C) Escalate to compliance without doing anything  
 D) Provide the file but complete the form afterward

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Rule 4 requires stopping when pressured to bypass procedures; maintain procedure and document pressure.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — supervisor instruction does not override safe stop rule.

**Item 7 (MCQ):** When escalating a PHI-related question to your supervisor, you should: A) Include all patient details so supervisor has full context  
 B) Use minimal necessary context, avoiding PHI when possible  
 C) Wait until end of shift to escalate  
 D) Escalate via public channel like team chat

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Rule 5 requires minimal necessary context during escalation.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — unnecessary PHI in escalation creates additional exposure.

**Item 8 (True/False):** Job aids are only for new employees; experienced employees should have procedures memorized.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Job aids are designed for real-time use at all experience levels to ensure consistency.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — misconception that memorization replaces job aids.

**Item 9 (MCQ):** You are uncertain if Microsoft Teams is approved for sharing X-rays with this client. What do you do? A) Use Teams since Microsoft is secure  
 B) Apply Rule 2 (channel), escalate to confirm approval before using  
 C) Ask a colleague and follow their advice  
 D) Use email instead

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Rule 2 requires confirmation of channel approval when uncertain.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — general security does not equal client-specific approval.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Which statement about safe stop rules is correct? A) Apply only if you remember them during the situation  
 B) Apply reflexively; they are mandatory halt conditions  
 C) Apply after completing the task if there was a problem  
 D) Apply only during training period

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Safe stop rules are reflexive mandatory conditions, not retrospective.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — must apply during the situation, not after.

**Item 11 (Scenario MCQ):** External email address requests patient records. Email has correct letterhead and looks professional. What is your first safe stop check? A) Verify requester identity using approved method  
 B) Check if request purpose is clear  
 C) Confirm channel is approved for external disclosure  
 D) All of the above

**Answer:** D  
 **Rationale:** All three rules apply: identity verification (Rule 1), external email channel verification (Rule 2), purpose assessment (Rule 3).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A only — missing that multiple rules can apply simultaneously.

**Item 12 (True/False):** If three safe stop rules are triggered simultaneously, you can address them in any order.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Use safe stop decision tree order: identity first, then channel, then purpose; all must be satisfied.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — order matters for systematic risk reduction.

**Item 13 (MCQ):** A job aid is: A) A test to assess your knowledge  
 B) A reference document used during work performance  
 C) A training module  
 D) A policy document

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Job aid definition is reference for just-in-time use during tasks.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — job aids are procedural tools, not policy statements.

**Item 14 (Short Answer):** List the five safe stop rules (triggers).

**Answer:**

1. Stop if identity not verified  
2. Stop if channel not approved  
3. Stop if request purpose unclear  
4. Stop if rushed/pressured to bypass steps  
5. Escalate with minimal necessary context

**Rationale:** Core safe stop rules all learners must know.

**Item 15 (Scenario MCQ):** You need help determining if a disclosure is permitted. You escalate to your supervisor by email saying: "I have a caller named Sarah Lee, DOB 3/15/1980, asking about her husband's cancer diagnosis. Can I disclose?" What is wrong with this escalation? A) Nothing; supervisor needs full context  
 B) Violated Rule 5 by including unnecessary PHI in escalation  
 C) Should have called instead of emailing  
 D)

Should have escalated by phone

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Rule 5 requires minimal necessary context; escalation question could be asked without patient name, DOB, or diagnosis: "Spouse is requesting other spouse's diagnosis. What verification/authorization is needed?"  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — including unnecessary PHI violates Rule 5\.

# **COURSE 1 MODULE BUILDS**

### **MODULE 1: PHI FUNDAMENTALS AND IDENTIFICATION (60 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** PHI (Protected Health Information) is the foundation of all healthcare compliance. PHI exists when you have BOTH an identifier (name, number, contact info, etc.) AND health or payment context. Your job requires you to read emails, tickets, notes, screenshots, and portal screens constantly — you must scan for PHI before using or sharing any content. Misidentifying PHI causes most data incidents. This module trains you to identify PHI in mixed content and apply redaction before sharing.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Scans all work content for PHI before forwarding or sharing  
* Identifies identifiers and health/payment context separately, then confirms both present  
* Applies redaction to remove unnecessary PHI before sharing  
* Escalates with sanitized excerpt when uncertain about PHI status

#### **2\) Definitions**

**PHI (Protected Health Information):** Information that identifies or can identify an individual AND relates to health condition, healthcare provision, or healthcare payment. Both elements required.

**ePHI (Electronic PHI):** PHI in electronic form (emails, databases, scanned documents, portal screens, text messages, digital photos).

**Identifier:** Data element that identifies or can identify an individual. Includes direct identifiers (name, MRN, SSN, account number, phone, email, address, photo) and indirect identifiers (age if rare, dates tied to care, small geographic areas).

**Direct Identifier:** Immediately identifies individual (name, MRN, SSN, specific account number, contact information, photo, biometric data).

**Indirect Identifier:** May identify individual in combination with other information (age over 89, dates related to care/payment, geographic subdivision smaller than state if population \< 20,000, device IDs).

**De-identification (needs\_review):** Process of removing identifiers to create information that cannot reasonably identify an individual. Two methods exist per federal standards (Expert Determination and Safe Harbor); client-specific de-identification requirements need\_review.

**Mixed Content:** Work objects (emails, tickets, notes) containing both PHI and non-PHI information requiring selective redaction.

**Redaction:** Removal or obscuring of specific identifiers or content before sharing, printing, or storing outside primary system.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Identify PHI in Any Work Object**

1. Identify object type receiving or reviewing (email, ticket, note, screenshot, document, portal screen, verbal conversation)  
2. Scan for identifiers using systematic approach:  
   * Names (patient, guarantor, family members if linked)  
   * Numbers (MRN, account number, claim number, insurance ID, SSN, phone number)  
   * Contact information (email, physical address, fax)  
   * Dates (DOB, admission, discharge, appointment dates, dates of service)  
   * Photos or images containing identifiable persons  
   * Account IDs or other unique identifiers  
3. Scan for health or payment context:  
   * Diagnosis, symptoms, complaints  
   * Treatment, procedures, medications  
   * Test results, clinical observations  
   * Appointment reasons or clinical service descriptions  
   * Claim status, payment information, billing details  
   * Insurance coverage or benefits information  
4. Apply two-element test:  
   * If identifier present BUT no health/payment context: may be sensitive but not PHI (e.g., patient name in general directory)  
   * If health/payment context present BUT no identifier: may be sensitive but not PHI (e.g., "patient with diabetes" in training with no identifiers)  
   * If BOTH identifier AND health/payment context present: treat as PHI  
5. When uncertain: treat as PHI and escalate with sanitized excerpt (Rule 5 from Module 0.6)  
6. Before sharing or storing outside primary system: apply minimum necessary redaction (remove unnecessary identifiers or context)

**Procedure: Apply Redaction Before Sharing**

1. Confirm purpose of sharing (why does recipient need this information?)  
2. Identify minimum necessary elements for that purpose  
3. Redact using approved method:  
   * Electronic documents: use redaction tool (permanent removal, not highlighting or strike-through)  
   * Emails: copy needed text to new email, do not forward with thread history containing extra PHI  
   * Screenshots: never take screenshots of PHI screens (Module 3 will reinforce); if existing screenshot must be shared for training, redact identifiers permanently  
   * Tickets: use structured fields to limit PHI, avoid free-text dumps  
4. Verify redaction permanence (cannot be removed or reversed)  
5. Confirm redacted version removes all unnecessary PHI  
6. Share redacted version only  
7. Document redaction in share note if required by procedure

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if unsure whether content contains PHI — treat as PHI until confirmed otherwise  
* Stop if you cannot determine minimum necessary scope — escalate before sharing  
* Stop if redaction method is unclear — escalate for approved tool/technique

**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → Compliance lead (for complex PHI determination questions)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Redaction decisions documented in ticket or share notes ("Redacted name and DOB per minimum necessary")  
* Uncertain PHI status escalations documented with sanitized excerpt only

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1:** Ticket note reads: "Pt \+ account 789456 called re aged balance. Coverage update provided. Requested resubmission via approved portal method. F/U scheduled."

**Analysis:**

* Identifiers: "Pt" (ambiguous but in system context identifies patient), account number 789456  
* Health/payment context: "aged balance," "coverage," "resubmission" (payment context)  
* PHI present: Yes (identifier \+ payment context)  
* Minimum necessary applied: Uses "pt" abbreviation instead of full name, provides account number (necessary for record tracking), describes action without unnecessary clinical detail

**Why Compliant:** PHI minimized while maintaining necessary documentation for continuity.

**Compliant Example 2:** Training artifact created from real ticket. All patient names, account numbers, phone numbers, dates of service, and diagnosis details removed. Template shows only: "Patient contacted regarding \[issue type\]. Action: \[generic action\]. Outcome: \[generic outcome\]."

**Analysis:**

* Original contained PHI  
* Redaction removed all identifiers  
* Health/payment context genericized to point of non-identification  
* Artifact suitable for training

**Why Compliant:** Complete removal of PHI for training use; no identifiable information remains.

**Non-Compliant Example:** Screenshot of live patient portal showing patient name "Sarah Johnson," DOB, MRN, diagnosis "leukemia," and appointment list. Screenshot sent via email with subject "Quick question about portal layout" to colleague for help troubleshooting navigation issue.

**Analysis:**

* Multiple identifiers present: name, DOB, MRN  
* Health context present: diagnosis, appointments  
* PHI clearly present  
* Screenshot unnecessary for navigation question  
* Email subject contains no PHI but body/attachment contains significant PHI  
* Purpose (navigation help) does not require patient identifiers

**Why Non-Compliant:** Screenshots of PHI screens prohibited (Module 3 will reinforce). Purpose did not require identifiable patient data; could have used training environment or described navigation issue without screenshot. Creates incident requiring immediate reporting and escalation per Module 10\. Sanctions likely (potentially acceleration clause depending on severity and repeat patterns).

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: PHI Identification (15 Artifacts, Timed 10 Minutes)**

Identify whether each contains PHI (Yes/No) and specify elements:

1. Email: "Please call Mrs. Anderson at 555-1234 to schedule her post-op follow-up."

   * **Answer:** Yes. Identifier: name \+ phone. Health context: post-op follow-up.  
2. Note: "System downtime scheduled for Saturday 2-4 AM."

   * **Answer:** No. No identifiers, no health/payment context.  
3. Ticket: "Account 12345 \- benefits verification complete, prior auth approved."

   * **Answer:** Yes. Identifier: account number. Payment context: benefits, prior auth.  
4. Screenshot showing clinic lobby with patient visible in waiting area.

   * **Answer:** Yes. Identifier: photo of individual. Health context: clinic setting (receiving healthcare).  
5. Email subject: "Claim status update."

   * **Answer:** No (subject line alone). No identifier present in subject. (Body may contain PHI.)  
6. Calendar entry: "Meeting with Johnson family \- discharge planning."

   * **Answer:** Yes. Identifier: family name. Health context: discharge planning.  
7. Training slide: "ICD-10 code J44.0 represents COPD with acute lower respiratory infection."

   * **Answer:** No. Code and condition definition with no patient identifier.  
8. Voicemail: "Hi, this is Dr. Smith's office calling for John Doe about your lab results. Call us back at 555-7890."

   * **Answer:** Yes. Identifiers: patient name implied by "John Doe" \+ caller ID context \+ callback number. Health context: lab results.  
9. Database export with columns: Account\_ID, Service\_Date, Service\_Code, Amount\_Billed (no names).

   * **Answer:** Yes. Identifier: Account\_ID (links to patient). Payment context: billing information.  
10. Sticky note: "Call scheduler re: afternoon slots."

    * **Answer:** No. No patient identifier, no specific health/payment context.  
11. Email thread with patient name in history section three emails down, current email has no identifiers.

    * **Answer:** Yes (thread contains PHI). Must review entire thread before forwarding.  
12. Portal screen showing "Patient Dashboard" title but all patient fields blank (test environment).

    * **Answer:** No. Test environment with no actual patient data.  
13. "Our clinic treats pediatric asthma cases."

    * **Answer:** No. General service description, no patient identifiers.  
14. "Sarah Lee, DOB 3/15/80, needs appointment rescheduled."

    * **Answer:** Yes. Identifiers: name \+ DOB. Health context: appointment (healthcare provision).  
15. Faxed document with patient name and diagnosis on page 1, page 2 is blank template.

    * **Answer:** Yes (document contains PHI on page 1). Cannot share page 2 alone if it was part of PHI-containing fax.

**Scoring:** 80% required \= 12/15 correct

**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** You receive email from clinic staff: "Can you help me understand why this claim denied? \[Screenshot attached showing patient name, MRN, claim number, denial code, denial reason 'diagnosis not specific enough'\]" You know how to resolve the issue (needs more specific diagnosis from provider). How do you respond applying PHI identification and minimum necessary?

**Answer:**

1. Identify PHI in email: Screenshot contains identifiers (name, MRN, claim number) \+ payment context (claim, denial) \= PHI present  
2. Assess minimum necessary for response: Clinic staff needs to know resolution steps; does NOT need you to reference patient-specific details in your response  
3. Respond: "The denial reason 'diagnosis not specific enough' requires provider documentation update. The provider should review the record and submit a more specific diagnosis code. I can help you with the resubmission process after the documentation is updated. Please do not send screenshots with patient information via email; you can reference the claim number only or call me to discuss."  
4. Document: Do not forward screenshot further; if you need to escalate, reference claim number only

**Why Compliant:** Provided resolution guidance without repeating patient identifiers, educated sender on screenshot prohibition, applied minimum necessary in response.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Colleague asking for help  
 **Learner plays:** Employee applying PHI identification

**Trainer:** "Hey, can you look at this ticket? I'm not sure what to do next. \[Shows screen with patient name, DOB, account number, and issue description visible\]"

**Learner expected actions:**

* Observe screen contains PHI (name, DOB, account number visible)  
* Assess own need-to-know: "Do I have access rights to this patient's account?"  
* If yes (authorized to help): Review ticket details as shown, provide guidance  
* If no (not authorized): "I cannot view patient details I'm not authorized for. Can you describe the issue without showing me the patient-specific screen? Or we can escalate to your supervisor."  
* Remind colleague: "In future, please describe the issue type without showing patient identifiers when asking for general guidance."

**Checklist: PHI Identification and Redaction**

* \[ \] Scanned object for identifiers (names, numbers, contacts, dates, images)  
* \[ \] Scanned object for health/payment context (diagnosis, treatment, claims, benefits)  
* \[ \] Applied two-element test (both identifier AND context \= PHI)  
* \[ \] If PHI present: determined minimum necessary for purpose  
* \[ \] If sharing: redacted unnecessary PHI permanently  
* \[ \] If uncertain: treated as PHI and escalated with sanitized excerpt  
* \[ \] Documented redaction decision or escalation

**Scoring Rubric:**

* PHI identification accuracy (15-item drill): 5 points (80% \= 12/15)  
* Redaction procedure: 2 points  
* Scenario application: 2 points  
* Checklist completion: 1 point  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (20 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** PHI requires: A) Identifier only  
 B) Health context only  
 C) Both identifier AND health/payment context  
 D) Electronic format

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** PHI \= identifier \+ health/payment context per definition.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — identifier alone is not sufficient.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Which is NOT PHI? A) Patient name \+ diagnosis  
 B) MRN \+ medication list  
 C) "Diabetes education class schedule" (no patient names)  
 D) Account number \+ claim status

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** No identifier present in general class schedule.

**Item 3 (True/False):** An email thread containing PHI in older messages is not PHI if your current reply has no PHI.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Entire thread must be assessed; historical PHI makes thread PHI-containing.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — forgetting to review full thread history.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Before sharing a ticket excerpt with a colleague, you should: A) Forward the entire ticket for complete context  
 B) Redact unnecessary PHI and share minimum necessary  
 C) Ask colleague to look over your shoulder instead  
 D) Print and hand-deliver to avoid electronic trail

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Apply minimum necessary through redaction before sharing.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — full ticket likely contains more PHI than necessary.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** A screenshot shows portal navigation buttons but no patient data visible. Is this PHI? A) Yes, portal screenshots are always PHI  
 B) No, no patient identifiers or health context visible  
 C) Yes, portal implies healthcare context  
 D) Depends on who views it

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** PHI requires identifier \+ context; blank navigation screen has neither.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — not all portal screenshots contain PHI; depends on content.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** "Pt \+ acct 789 called re balance" contains: A) No PHI  
 B) Identifier only  
 C) Health context only  
 D) PHI (identifier \+ payment context)

**Answer:** D  
 **Rationale:** "Pt" \+ account number (identifiers) \+ balance (payment context) \= PHI.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — missing that "balance" is payment context.

**Item 7 (True/False):** If you are unsure whether content contains PHI, you should treat it as non-PHI to avoid over-restricting workflow.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Safe stop rule: if uncertain, treat as PHI and escalate.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — underestimating risk of misidentification.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** Redaction means: A) Highlighting PHI in yellow  
 B) Using strike-through text  
 C) Permanent removal or obscuring that cannot be reversed  
 D) Saving file in protected folder

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Redaction must be permanent and irreversible.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — strike-through can often be removed.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** You need to show a trainer how to complete a specific form field. The form has patient data populated. What do you do? A) Show the live form as-is  
 B) Use a test environment or blank template  
 C) Verbally describe without showing screen  
 D) Show quickly so it's not a disclosure

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Training should use test environments or blank templates, not live PHI.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — duration does not exempt from PHI handling rules.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** DOB alone without any other identifier is: A) Always PHI  
 B) Never PHI  
 C) PHI if combined with health/payment context and can identify individual  
 D) Only PHI for children

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** DOB becomes PHI when combined with health context and can identify individual (especially if rare DOB in dataset).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — DOB can be PHI in combination.

**Item 11 (MCQ):** Which scenario requires immediate PHI incident reporting? A) You identify PHI in a ticket and redact before sharing  
 B) You accidentally view PHI you don't need, immediately close, report  
 C) You apply minimum necessary successfully  
 D) You ask supervisor if content contains PHI

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Unnecessary access (even if immediately corrected) is reportable incident.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — proper redaction before sharing is compliant, not an incident.

**Item 12 (True/False):** "Patient with hypertension" in a training scenario with no names or numbers is PHI.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** No identifier present; health context alone is not PHI.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — confusing sensitive content with PHI.

**Item 13 (MCQ):** Direct identifiers include: A) Age and gender  
 B) Name and MRN  
 C) Diagnosis and treatment  
 D) State and city

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Direct identifiers immediately identify individuals (name, MRN, SSN, etc.).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — age and gender are attributes but not direct identifiers.

**Item 14 (Scenario MCQ):** Colleague asks "Can you check if John Smith's claim processed?" How do you respond applying minimum necessary? A) "Yes, I'll check John Smith's claim."  
 B) "What is the account or claim number? I'll check by that."  
 C) "I cannot help with patient-specific questions."  
 D) "Let me look up John Smith in the system."

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Use account/claim number (necessary) instead of name when possible (minimum necessary).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — repeating name unnecessarily in your response.

**Item 15 (MCQ):** ePHI includes: A) Only encrypted data  
 B) Only data in electronic health records  
 C) Any PHI created, stored, transmitted, or received electronically  
 D) Only data on secure servers

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** ePHI is any PHI in electronic form regardless of security status or location.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — not limited to EHRs.

**Item 16 (True/False):** Indirect identifiers can only identify individuals when combined with other information.

**Answer:** True  
 **Rationale:** Indirect identifiers (age over 89, small geographic areas, rare dates) identify in combination.

**Item 17 (MCQ):** You create training materials from real tickets. What must you do? A) Use tickets as-is for realism  
 B) Remove all identifiers and genericize health/payment context  
 C) Only remove patient names  
 D) Encrypt the files

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Training artifacts must be fully de-identified (all identifiers removed, context genericized).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — removing only names leaves other identifiers (account numbers, dates, etc.).

**Item 18 (Scenario MCQ):** You receive fax with patient name on page 1 and blank form on page 2\. You need to share the blank form with a colleague as a template. What do you do? A) Share page 2 only  
 B) Share entire fax since page 2 is blank  
 C) Recreate blank form from scratch or use approved template library  
 D) Redact name on page 1 and share both pages

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Even blank page from PHI-containing document may carry contamination risk; use approved templates or recreate.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — separating pages may not fully remove association with PHI document.

**Item 19 (Short Answer):** List three examples of direct identifiers.

**Answer:** (Any three of: name, MRN, SSN, account number, phone number, email address, physical address, photo, biometric data, IP address, device ID)

**Rationale:** Direct identifiers immediately identify individuals.

**Item 20 (Scenario MCQ):** Ticket note says "Contact provided re aged balance. Action: sent statement." Contains account number in system but not in note text. Is the note PHI? A) No, note text has no identifiers  
 B) Yes, account number in system associates note with patient  
 C) Only if you copy the note outside the system  
 D) Only if amount is visible

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Note in patient account context creates identifier association even if note text doesn't repeat identifier.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — context within system creates PHI association.

### **MODULE 2: PERMITTED USES AND DISCLOSURES FRAMEWORK (75 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Not every request for PHI is allowed. You must understand which disclosures are permitted before sharing any PHI. The framework is: Treatment, Payment, Operations (TPO) disclosures may be permitted by client policy; patient/authorized representative requests are generally permitted; all other requests require authorization on file or escalation. Your role is NOT to independently decide what's allowed — you follow client policy, check for authorization, and escalate when unclear. Mistakes in disclosure decisions cause breaches.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Identifies requester type (patient, payer, provider, family, internal, other)  
* Identifies stated purpose (treatment, payment, operations, unknown)  
* Checks client policy or authorization registry before disclosing  
* Refuses disclosure using approved script when not clearly permitted  
* Escalates ambiguous requests with minimal necessary context  
* Documents disclosure decision basis without extra PHI

#### **2\) Definitions**

**TPO (Treatment, Payment, Operations):** Three categories of healthcare activities for which PHI disclosures may be permitted without patient authorization under HIPAA, subject to client-specific policies (needs\_review).

**Treatment:** Activities related to providing, coordinating, or managing healthcare and related services. Examples: provider consultations, referrals, care coordination.

**Payment:** Activities to obtain reimbursement for healthcare services. Examples: billing, claims processing, payment posting, collections, benefits verification, prior authorization.

**Operations:** Administrative, quality, and business activities. Examples: quality improvement, case management, training (with de-identified data), audits, legal/compliance.

**Business Associate (needs\_review):** Entity performing services for covered entity involving PHI access (payers, clearinghouses, vendors). Business associate agreements govern permitted disclosures; client-specific BA lists need\_review.

**Authorization:** Written permission from patient (or legal representative) specifying what PHI can be disclosed, to whom, for what purpose, and expiration date. Must be on file before disclosure for non-TPO purposes.

**Representative:** Individual legally authorized to act on patient's behalf (legal guardian, healthcare power of attorney, parent of minor, executor of estate). Authorization status needs\_review per client procedures.

**Escalation Trigger:** Situation requiring supervisor or privacy officer review before disclosure decision (ambiguous purpose, missing authorization, conflicting information, unusual request).

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Evaluate Disclosure Requests**

1. Identify requester type:

   * Patient themselves (photo ID verification at minimum)  
   * Patient's authorized representative (requires authorization verification — needs\_review per client)  
   * Payer (insurance company, claims processor)  
   * Provider (referring physician, treating facility, consultant)  
   * Family member (not automatically authorized)  
   * Internal staff (must have need-to-know for role)  
   * Other (attorney, employer, media, law enforcement, etc.)  
2. Identify stated purpose:

   * Treatment (care coordination, referral, consultation)  
   * Payment (billing, claim, coverage, prior auth)  
   * Operations (quality, audit, case management)  
   * Patient request (patient accessing own information)  
   * Other/unclear  
3. Check applicable authority:

   * For patient requests: verify identity using Module 4 procedures  
   * For payer requests: confirm client policy allows disclosure for stated payment purpose (needs\_review per client); many require verification of payer identity  
   * For provider requests: confirm treatment relationship and verify provider identity (needs\_review per client procedures)  
   * For family/representative requests: check authorization on file before proceeding  
   * For other requests: authorization required unless specific law mandates disclosure  
4. Make disclosure decision:

   * If clearly permitted by client policy AND identity verified AND minimum necessary determined: proceed with disclosure  
   * If not clearly permitted by client policy: refuse using approved script, offer alternative (e.g., patient can authorize disclosure), escalate if requester persists  
   * If authorization required but not on file: refuse, explain how to submit authorization  
   * If uncertain about any element: escalate before disclosing (safe stop Rule 3 and 5\)  
5. Document decision basis:

   * Requester type and verified identity  
   * Stated purpose  
   * Policy basis for disclosure or refusal  
   * What was disclosed (minimum necessary items)  
   * If refused: refusal reason and alternative offered  
   * If escalated: escalation timestamp and decision outcome

**Procedure: Refuse Disclosure Safely**

1. Listen to full request without interrupting  
2. Acknowledge request: "I understand you're requesting \[information type\]."  
3. State refusal clearly and professionally: "I'm unable to provide that information without \[authorization/verification/policy confirmation\]."  
4. Explain reason briefly: "Our policy requires \[specific requirement\] before we can share this information."  
5. Offer alternative: "You can \[submit written authorization/contact the patient to request release/verify identity through this process\]."  
6. If requester argues or pressures: repeat refusal calmly, do not deviate from script  
7. If pressure continues (safe stop Rule 4): "I need to escalate this request to my supervisor. Please hold or I can call you back within \[timeframe\]."  
8. End interaction professionally: "Is there anything else I can help with that doesn't require this information?"  
9. Document: requester details, request, refusal reason, alternative offered, any pressure tactics used

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if stated purpose is unclear or changes during conversation — escalate  
* Stop if requester cannot or will not verify identity — refuse disclosure  
* Stop if authorization status is uncertain — escalate before disclosing  
* Stop if you are being pressured to disclose "just this once" — maintain refusal, escalate

**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → Privacy officer (for disclosure decision confirmation)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* All disclosure decisions documented in disclosure log or ticket with: requester, purpose, authority basis, what disclosed, date/time  
* Refusals documented with reason and alternative offered  
* Escalations documented with decision outcome

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- Spouse Request (Source Scenario 2):** Caller: "This is John Smith. I need my wife Sarah's test results. We're married."

Employee: "I understand you'd like Sarah's test results. Our policy requires authorization from Sarah before I can share her information with anyone else, including spouses. Is Sarah available to speak with me directly, or she can complete an authorization form allowing us to speak with you."

Caller: "She's at work. Can't you just tell me?"

Employee: "I'm unable to share without her authorization. Sarah can call us directly, or if she completes an authorization form naming you, we can discuss her information with you. Would you like me to email her the authorization form instructions at the address we have on file?"

**Why Compliant:** Correctly identified spouse is not automatically authorized, refused disclosure using script, offered alternatives (patient calls directly or submits authorization), maintained refusal despite pressure, documented interaction.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Payer Request (needs\_review for client-specific):** Payer representative calls: "This is Claims Department at Blue Cross calling about claim 123456 for patient account 789\. We need the office visit notes to process the claim."

Employee: "I need to verify your identity first. May I have your name, department, and a callback number at Blue Cross?" \[Verifies using client procedure for payer verification — needs\_review\]. "Thank you. Let me confirm our policy allows this disclosure for claims processing purposes." \[Checks policy, confirms payment purpose disclosure permitted\]. "I can send the office visit notes via \[approved method — needs\_review\]. The fax number on file is \[verifies number\]. You should receive within one business day."

**Why Compliant:** Verified payer identity per procedure, confirmed client policy permits payment-purpose disclosure, used approved transmission method, applied minimum necessary (only office visit notes requested, not entire medical record), documented disclosure.

**Non-Compliant Example:** Family member calls: "Hi, this is Dr. Johnson's daughter. He was admitted yesterday and I'm out of state. Can you tell me what his diagnosis is and when he can go home?"

Employee: "Oh sure, let me look... He has pneumonia and should be discharged tomorrow if his oxygen levels improve."

**Why Non-Compliant:** Multiple violations:

* Did not verify identity (family member may not be who they claim)  
* Did not check for authorization on file before disclosing to family member  
* Disclosed diagnosis and treatment plan without confirming daughter is authorized representative  
* Did not verify patient wants daughter to have this information  
* Source Scenario 2 directly addresses this pattern

**Correct Response:** "I understand you're concerned about your father. Our policy requires me to verify with him that he authorizes me to share his medical information with you. Is he available to speak with me now? Alternatively, he can complete an authorization form that allows us to speak with specific family members."

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Approve/Deny/Escalate Flashcards (15 Scenarios)**

Classify each request as: A) Approve (clearly permitted), D) Deny (clearly prohibited), E) Escalate (uncertain)

1. Patient requests own test results after verifying identity → A (patient right to access)  
2. Spouse requests diagnosis without authorization on file → D (family not automatically authorized)  
3. Payer requests claim documentation for payment processing, policy confirms permitted → A (payment purpose, policy allows)  
4. Provider requests records for treatment, but caller identity not verified → E (purpose may be permitted but identity verification incomplete)  
5. Employer requests employee fitness-for-duty certification → E (requires authorization unless specific workers' comp or required by law)  
6. Patient's attorney requests records, no authorization on file → D (requires patient authorization)  
7. Patient's mother requests information, patient is 35 years old → D (adult patient, parent not automatically authorized)  
8. Internal staff member requests access, but purpose is unclear → E (internal access requires need-to-know; unclear purpose triggers escalation)  
9. Law enforcement requests records without warrant or subpoena → E (requires legal review of specific circumstances — needs\_review)  
10. Patient requests records be sent to new provider, identity verified → A (patient direction of own information)  
11. Insurance broker "helping patient" requests coverage details → D (broker not automatically authorized; patient must request directly or provide authorization)  
12. Collection agency requests patient contact information for debt collection → E (payment purpose but requires verification of BA status and client policy — needs\_review)  
13. Researcher requests de-identified data for study → E (requires privacy officer review of de-identification adequacy and IRB approval)  
14. Patient's legal guardian requests information (guardianship papers on file) → A (legal guardian is authorized representative)  
15. Media requests information about patient involved in news story → D (no disclosure without patient authorization)

**Scoring:** 80% \= 12/15 correct

**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** Three-party call: patient, patient's insurance case manager, and you. Patient verified identity at call start. Case manager asks about upcoming surgery details to coordinate post-op care. Patient is silent. What do you do?

**Answer:**

1. Acknowledge request: "I understand you're asking about the surgery to coordinate care."  
2. Verify patient consent in real-time: "Mr./Ms. \[Patient\], are you still on the line? Do you authorize me to discuss your surgery details with \[Case Manager Name\] from \[Insurance Company\] for care coordination purposes?"  
3. If patient confirms verbally: "Thank you. \[Proceeds with disclosure to case manager\]"  
4. If patient is uncertain or silent: "Let me give you and \[Case Manager\] a moment. Mr./Ms. \[Patient\], you can call me back directly if you'd like to discuss this privately first."  
5. Document: Three-party call, patient verbal authorization obtained (or not obtained), what was disclosed

**Why Correct:** Even though patient initiated the call and verified identity, explicit verbal consent required before discussing PHI with third party on line. Patient silence is not consent.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Caller requesting information  
 **Learner plays:** Employee evaluating disclosure request

**Round 1 \- Pressure Scenario:** **Trainer:** "This is the billing office at Northside Clinic. We need patient insurance information for Jane Doe immediately. She's here now waiting to be seen and forgot her card."

**Learner expected actions:**

1. Identify requester type: provider office (treatment context)  
2. Verify identity: "May I have your name, the clinic's phone number, and Jane Doe's date of birth?"  
3. Verify patient presence: "Is Jane available to speak with me directly to authorize this disclosure?" OR "Can Jane verify her identity and give permission?"  
4. If Jane verifies and authorizes: provide insurance information  
5. If Jane cannot verify or clinic resists: "I need Jane to verify directly or we can send information to the clinic through our standard records release process."  
6. If pressured: "I understand this is urgent for her appointment, but I need to follow our verification procedure to protect Jane's information."

**Round 2 \- Ambiguous Purpose:** **Trainer:** "Hi, I'm calling from Community Health Partners about one of your patients. Can you tell me what appointments they have coming up?"

**Learner expected actions:**

1. Identify unclear elements: Which patient? What is specific purpose? Is this treatment coordination or something else?  
2. Clarify: "Can you tell me the patient's name and the specific reason you need their appointment information?"  
3. Assess stated purpose against TPO framework  
4. If treatment coordination and identity verifiable: may proceed if policy allows  
5. If purpose remains unclear: "I need to escalate this request to verify our policy allows this disclosure. May I call you back at \[verified number\]?"  
6. Escalate with minimal context: Document requester, vague purpose, need for policy clarification

**Checklist: Disclosure Decision Process**

* \[ \] Identified requester type (patient/representative/payer/provider/family/internal/other)  
* \[ \] Identified stated purpose (treatment/payment/operations/patient access/other/unclear)  
* \[ \] Verified requester identity using appropriate method (Module 4 procedures)  
* \[ \] Checked client policy or authorization on file  
* \[ \] If unclear: escalated before disclosing  
* \[ \] If denying: used refusal script, offered alternative  
* \[ \] If approving: applied minimum necessary  
* \[ \] Documented decision basis completely

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Requester type identification: 1 point  
* Purpose identification: 1 point  
* Identity verification: 2 points  
* Policy/authorization check: 2 points

* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (15 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** TPO stands for: A) Transfer, Payment, Operations  
 B) Treatment, Privacy, Operations  
 C) Treatment, Payment, Operations  
 D) Transfer, Privacy, Oversight

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** TPO \= Treatment, Payment, Operations.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** A spouse requests patient's diagnosis. What is required before disclosure? A) Nothing; spouses are automatically authorized  
 B) Authorization from patient on file or patient present to authorize  
 C) Marriage certificate  
 D) Only if patient is incapacitated

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Spouses are not automatically authorized; requires patient authorization.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — Source Scenario 2 directly addresses this misconception.

**Item 3 (True/False):** If a provider calls requesting treatment-related information, you can disclose immediately without verification.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Must verify caller identity and confirm client policy allows treatment disclosures to that provider.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — forgetting identity verification requirement.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Your role in disclosure decisions is to: A) Independently decide what's in patient's best interest  
 B) Follow client policy, check authorizations, escalate when uncertain  
 C) Always default to denying requests  
 D) Defer all decisions to supervisor

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Staff follow policy and escalate; do not make independent judgments.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — exceeding role boundaries.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Patient's adult child calls asking about mother's medication list. Mother is 68 years old and competent. What do you do? A) Provide medication list; adult children are authorized  
 B) Refuse; check for authorization on file first  
 C) Ask mother's permission verbally over phone  
 D) Provide general information but not specifics

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Adult children not automatically authorized for competent adult patients.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — assuming family relationship creates authorization.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Authorization on file must specify: A) Only patient name  
 B) What information, to whom, purpose, expiration date  
 C) Only who can receive information  
 D) Verbal permission is sufficient

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Authorization requires specific elements: what, to whom, purpose, expiration.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — authorization must be written.

**Item 7 (True/False):** If a caller becomes angry and demands information, you should disclose to de-escalate the situation.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Pressure does not override disclosure rules; safe stop Rule 4 applies.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — prioritizing conflict avoidance over compliance.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** Business Associate disclosures require: A) Patient authorization for each disclosure  
 B) Business associate agreement on file and permitted purpose  
 C) Only verbal agreement  
 D) No special requirements

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** BA disclosures require BAA and legitimate purpose (needs\_review per client).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — TPO disclosures to BAs don't require individual authorizations if BAA covers.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Payer requests claim documentation. You check policy and confirm payment-purpose disclosure is permitted. What else must you do before disclosing? A) Nothing; proceed with disclosure  
 B) Verify payer identity and apply minimum necessary  
 C) Get patient authorization  
 D) Wait for supervisor approval

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Must verify requester identity and apply minimum necessary even for permitted disclosures.

 B) Use refusal script, explain reason briefly, offer alternative  
 C) Explain detailed legal reasons  
 D) Transfer to supervisor immediately

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Professional refusal includes script, brief reason, alternative.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — escalation not needed for straightforward refusals.

**Item 11 (True/False):** "I'm just checking on my neighbor" is a sufficient purpose for disclosure.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** "Just checking" is insufficient purpose; also no authorization (safe stop Rule 3).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — not recognizing insufficient purpose.

**Item 12 (MCQ):** Patient requests records be sent to attorney. What do you need? A) Attorney's bar number  
 B) Signed authorization from patient specifying attorney and purpose  
 C) Patient verbal permission  
 D) Court order

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Patient direction requires written authorization specifying recipient and purpose.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — verbal permission insufficient for third-party disclosure.

**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** Internal staff member asks for patient information. They say "I need it for my work." What do you do? A) Provide; they're internal so it's fine  
 B) Ask specific purpose, verify need-to-know, check if they have appropriate access rights  
 C) Deny; internal staff must access systems themselves  
 D) Provide if they're management level

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Internal access requires need-to-know verification and appropriate permissions.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "internal" doesn't eliminate need-to-know requirement.

**Item 14 (Short Answer):** What are the three escalation triggers that should cause you to stop and escalate before making disclosure decision?

**Answer:**

1. Ambiguous or unclear purpose  
2. Missing or uncertain authorization status  
3. Unusual or complex request outside normal workflow

**Rationale:** These situations require privacy officer or supervisor review.

**Item 15 (MCQ):** Documentation of disclosure decisions must include: A) Only what was disclosed  
 B) Requester, purpose, authority basis, what disclosed, date/time  
 C) Only if disclosure was denied  
 D) Patient's medical information for context

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Complete disclosure documentation includes all decision elements.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — both approvals and denials must be documented.

### **MODULE 3: MINIMUM NECESSARY AND ACCESS CONTROLS (90 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Minimum Necessary is the cornerstone of PHI protection: only access, use, and share what you need for your specific task. Most access violations are not hackers — they're employees accessing more than necessary, browsing out of curiosity, or failing to remove unused permissions. This module trains least privilege (narrowest access needed for role), preventing access creep (accumulating unnecessary permissions over time), recognizing curiosity browsing (accessing records without job need), requesting access formally with justification, and auditing your own permissions periodically.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* States task purpose before opening any record  
* Opens only minimum screens/fields required for task  
* Never accesses records of known individuals without job need  
* Files formal access requests with written justification when current access insufficient  
* Conducts periodic self-audit of access permissions  
* Closes record immediately if curiosity temptation arises

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Least Privilege:** Security principle requiring users have only minimum access rights needed to perform assigned duties. No more, no less.

**Role-Based Access:** Access permissions granted based on job role, not individual requests. Common in healthcare systems (e.g., "billing clerk" role has specific permissions).

**Access Creep:** Gradual accumulation of unnecessary access permissions over time, usually from role changes, temporary assignments, or failure to remove old permissions.

**Curiosity Browsing:** Accessing patient records without legitimate job need, driven by personal interest (celebrity patients, neighbors, family members, coworkers, newsworthy cases). Serious violation often resulting in termination.

**Need-to-Know:** Legitimate job requirement to access specific information to perform assigned duties. "Nice to know" or "want to know" is not sufficient.

**Access Request:** Formal documented request for additional system permissions, including justification of job need and scope of access requested.

**Access Removal:** Formal documented removal of permissions no longer needed (after role change, project completion, or identified during self-audit).

**Audit Trail:** System log recording who accessed what information, when, and from where. All access is logged and subject to review.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Access Records with Least Privilege**

1. Before opening any patient record, state task purpose in your own words (mental or verbal check): "I need to \[specific task\] for \[specific reason\]."  
2. Confirm patient identifier matches task (right patient, right account)  
3. Open only the minimum screens/sections required:  
   * For benefits verification: demographics and insurance section only  
   * For payment posting: billing/payment screens only  
   * For appointment scheduling: scheduling and contact information only  
   * Avoid opening clinical notes, test results, or diagnoses unless directly required for your specific task  
4. Complete task efficiently without browsing unrelated sections  
5. Log out or close record when task complete  
6. If you accidentally open wrong record or unnecessary section: close immediately, do not read content, document access in incident report if you viewed PHI

**Procedure: Recognize and Prevent Curiosity Browsing**

1. Apply curiosity self-check before accessing any record: "Do I have a job need to access this record right now?"  
2. High-risk scenarios requiring extra vigilance:  
   * Records of celebrities, public figures, or anyone in news  
   * Records of neighbors, friends, family members, coworkers, yourself  
   * Records tied to newsworthy events (crimes, accidents, unusual diagnoses)  
   * Records you're personally interested in for non-work reasons  
3. If you identify personal interest without job need: STOP, close without accessing, walk away  
4. If you already accessed without job need (even briefly): close immediately, report as incident to supervisor: "I accessed \[account\] without job need. I closed immediately. Please document this incident."  
5. Understand consequences: curiosity browsing typically results in termination under acceleration clause, even for first offense

**Safe Stop for Curiosity:** If you feel curious — stop and close. Curiosity is never a legitimate job need.

**Procedure: Request Access When Current Permissions Insufficient**

1. Identify specific access need: "I need \[specific permission\] to \[specific task\]."  
2. Confirm need is ongoing or temporary:  
   * Ongoing: role-based access request (permanent permission)  
   * Temporary: time-limited access request with end date  
3. Complete access request form with required fields:  
   * Your name and current role  
   * System/module needing access  
   * Specific permission level requested (read-only, read-write, etc.)  
   * Business justification (why needed for job duties)  
   * If temporary: requested end date  
   * Supervisor approval signature  
4. Submit to IT/access management per client procedure (needs\_review)  
5. Do not attempt to access before approval granted  
6. If approval delayed and task urgent: escalate to supervisor; do not improvise workarounds

**Procedure: Audit Your Own Access Permissions (Self-Audit Lab)**

1. Schedule self-audit quarterly or per client requirement (needs\_review)  
2. Access your user profile in each system you use  
3. Review current permissions list  
4. For each permission, ask: "Do I currently need this for my role?"  
5. Identify unused permissions:  
   * Permissions from prior role no longer applicable  
   * Temporary access granted for completed project  
   * System access for pods/clients no longer assigned to you  
6. Draft access removal request for identified unused permissions  
7. Submit to supervisor for approval and processing  
8. Document self-audit completion with date and findings

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if you feel curiosity about a record — close without accessing  
* Stop if you need access you don't have — request formally, do not borrow credentials  
* Stop if you realize you have permissions you don't use — request removal

**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → IT/access management → Compliance (for access violations)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Access requests: system, permission, justification, approval, grant date  
* Access removals: system, permission removed, date  
* Self-audit: date conducted, permissions reviewed, removals requested  
* Curiosity browsing incidents: immediate self-report with account accessed and acknowledgment

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1:** Employee's role is Order Entry Specialist. Receives access request form approval for new payer portal required for job. Form specifies: System: ABC Insurance Portal, Permission: Read claims status, Justification: "Required to verify prior authorization status for orders per role duties," Supervisor signature present, End date: None (ongoing role need). Employee submits to IT, waits for access grant notification, then uses portal for job tasks only.

**Why Compliant:** Formal access request with specific scope and justification, supervisor approved, waited for proper grant, uses for stated purpose only.

**Compliant Example 2:** Employee conducts quarterly self-audit. Discovers they still have "Pod 3" permissions from six months ago when temporarily helped that pod. Current assignment is Pod 7 only. Employee drafts access removal request: "Remove Pod 3 system access. No longer assigned to Pod 3 as of \[date\]. Current assignment is Pod 7." Submits to supervisor.

**Why Compliant:** Proactive identification of access creep, formal removal request, addresses unused permissions reducing risk.

**Non-Compliant Example (Source Scenario 20 \- Curiosity Browsing):** Employee lives in neighborhood. Neighbor was in car accident (employee saw ambulance yesterday). Employee is curious about neighbor's condition. Employee opens neighbor's chart during slow work period to "see diagnosis." Record shows multiple injuries and admission details. Employee reads for 2-3 minutes. System audit flags unauthorized access. Investigation confirms employee has no job need to access neighbor's record. Employee terminated under acceleration clause.

**Why Non-Compliant:** Textbook curiosity browsing violation. No job need, access driven purely by personal interest. Even brief duration and no sharing of information does not mitigate. Source explicitly identifies this pattern; Course 1 scenario library includes this example. Result: immediate termination, possible regulatory report depending on jurisdiction.

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Access Scenarios \- Allowed vs Violation (8 Scenarios)**

Classify each as: A) Allowed (legitimate access), V) Violation (unauthorized access)

1. Benefits coordinator accesses patient demographics and insurance screens to verify coverage → A  
2. Billing clerk opens clinical notes to "understand the case better" when processing claim → V (clinical notes not needed for billing unless specifically required for medical necessity determination per role)  
3. Scheduler accesses patient's full medical history to find appointment dates → V (appointment dates in scheduling module; medical history unnecessary)  
4. Claims specialist accesses colleague's spouse's account out of curiosity → V (curiosity browsing, no job need)  
5. Nurse coordinator accesses patient record to review medication list for care coordination call → A (legitimate treatment coordination task)  
6. Manager accesses multiple records to audit documentation quality per assigned audit project → A (legitimate operations purpose with defined scope)  
7. Employee accesses celebrity patient record to "see if they're really here" → V (curiosity browsing, no job need)  
8. Revenue cycle specialist accesses payment history for account they're assigned to work → A (legitimate payment task)

**Scoring:** 80% \= 7/8 correct (note: 6/8 is 75%, so must get 7/8)

**Scenario Exercise: Role Drift** **Scenario:** You were temporarily assigned to help Authorization Pod for two months. That project ended three months ago. You're now back to your regular Collections Pod role. You still have Authorization Pod system access (nobody removed it). Today, a colleague in Authorization Pod asks "Can you just check this authorization status quickly? You still have access."

**Question:** What should you do and why?

**Answer:**

1. Decline access: "I no longer have job need for that system since I'm not in Authorization Pod. I should not access it."  
2. Direct colleague: "Please route this through your pod supervisor or someone currently assigned to Authorization."  
3. File access removal request: Document that Authorization Pod access should be removed (access creep identified)  
4. If already accessed before realizing: Self-report as incident, document that temporary access wasn't removed after assignment ended

**Why Correct:** Access permissions should match current role. Helping another pod using old permissions violates least privilege even if you're capable of the task. Identifies access creep and takes corrective action.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Peer asking for access help  
 **Learner plays:** Employee applying access controls

**Scenario:** "Hey, I forgot my password and I'm slammed. Can I use your login really quick to check this one account?"

**Learner expected actions:**

1. Refuse immediately: "I can't share my credentials. That violates our access policy."  
2. Offer proper alternative: "Contact IT for a password reset. It usually takes 5-10 minutes."  
3. If peer pressures: "I understand you're busy, but sharing credentials creates security and compliance issues. I have to say no."  
4. Document pressure attempt if it continues (Source Scenario 13 addresses credential sharing pressure)  
5. Do NOT log in on peer's behalf or share credentials under any circumstance

**Checklist: Least Privilege Access**

* \[ \] Stated task purpose before opening record (mental check minimum)  
* \[ \] Opened only minimum screens needed for specific task  
* \[ \] Did not browse unrelated sections  
* \[ \] Did not access records of known individuals without job need  
* \[ \] Closed record immediately after task completion  
* \[ \] If curiosity arose: stopped and closed without accessing  
* \[ \] If access insufficient: filed formal access request, did not borrow credentials  
* \[ \] Conducted self-audit on schedule, identified unused permissions  
* \[ \] Documented any incidents (accidental access, curiosity stopped, etc.)

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Access scenario identification (8 items): 4 points (7/8 \= 87.5%)  
* Least privilege procedure: 2 points  
* Curiosity prevention: 2 points  
* Access request/removal understanding: 2 points  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (15 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Least privilege means: A) Minimum access needed for job duties  
 B) No access without supervisor present  
 C) Access only during business hours  
 D) Shared access across teams

**Answer:** A  
 **Rationale:** Least privilege \= minimum access needed for assigned duties.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Curiosity browsing is: A) Reading medical journals  
 B) Accessing patient records without job need  
 C) Browsing training materials  
 D) Reviewing your own medical records

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Curiosity browsing \= accessing records without legitimate job need, driven by personal interest.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — accessing own records may be permitted depending on policy but is separate issue.

**Item 3 (True/False):** If you have system access permission, you can use it for any patient in that system.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Access permission does not equal need-to-know; must have job need for each specific access.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — conflating technical access with legitimate authorization.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Access creep occurs when: A) System runs slowly  
 B) Permissions accumulate over time without removal  
 C) Too many people have access  
 D) Access requests take too long

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Access creep \= accumulation of unnecessary permissions over time.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** You need access to a new system for your job. Your colleague offers to let you use their login "until yours is set up." What do you do? A) Accept to avoid workflow delay  
 B) Decline and file formal access request  
 C) Use it but log with your name  
 D) Share your login in exchange

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Credential sharing prohibited; must use formal access request process.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — urgency does not excuse credential sharing (Source Scenario 13).

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Before opening any patient record, you should: A) Check if anyone is watching  
 B) State task purpose and confirm legitimate job need  
 C) Log the access manually  
 D) Ask supervisor permission

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Purpose check before access prevents unauthorized access.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — routine access within role doesn't require per-record supervisor approval.

**Item 7 (True/False):** Accessing a celebrity patient's record is acceptable if you only look briefly and don't tell anyone.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Any curiosity browsing is violation regardless of duration or disclosure.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — "brief" and "didn't share" do not mitigate unauthorized access.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** Self-audit of access permissions should occur: A) Never; IT manages access  
 B) Only when changing roles  
 C) Quarterly or per client requirement  
 D) Only if supervisor requests

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Periodic self-audit (typically quarterly) identifies access creep.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — employees share responsibility for appropriate access.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** You accidentally open wrong patient record. What do you do? A) Close immediately and document if PHI viewed  
 B) Quickly fix your work in the wrong record  
 C) Delete the access log entry  
 D) Tell the patient you accessed their record

**Answer:** A  
 **Rationale:** Immediate closure minimizes exposure; documentation required if PHI viewed (incident reporting).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — never delete or alter audit logs.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Access request justification should include: A) Why it would be convenient  
 B) Specific job need and tasks requiring access  
 C) How long you've worked there  
 D) What other people have access

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Justification must demonstrate legitimate job need.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — convenience is insufficient justification.

**Item 11 (True/False):** If you discover you have permissions you no longer need, you can just not use them instead of requesting removal.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Unused permissions should be formally removed to reduce access creep and risk.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — "not using" doesn't eliminate the access risk; formal removal required.

**Item 12 (MCQ):** Accessing your neighbor's record to check on their health after you saw an ambulance is: A) Acceptable if you're concerned  
 B) Acceptable if you're a healthcare worker  
 C) Curiosity browsing violation, likely resulting in termination  
 D) Acceptable as long as you don't share information

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Source Scenario 20 explicitly addresses this pattern; curiosity browsing with likely termination.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — concern does not create job need.

**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** Your role is Billing. You can see clinical notes in the system. Should you read them when processing claims? A) Yes, always for complete context  
 B) Only if needed for medical necessity determination per role procedures  
 C) No, never access clinical notes  
 D) Only if claim is complex

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Access only what's needed for specific task; clinical notes may or may not be necessary depending on billing task and role procedures.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "complete context" violates minimum necessary.

**Item 14 (Short Answer):** What are the three types of high-risk curiosity browsing scenarios requiring extra vigilance?

**Answer:**

1. Records of celebrities, public figures, or people in news  
2. Records of people you know (neighbors, friends, family, coworkers, yourself)  
3. Records tied to newsworthy events or unusual cases you're personally interested in

**Rationale:** These scenarios create personal interest that conflicts with job need.

**Item 15 (MCQ):** Consequences of curiosity browsing typically include: A) Counseling for first offense  
 B) Written warning  
 C) Termination under acceleration clause, even first offense  
 D) Mandatory retraining

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Curiosity browsing is high-severity violation typically resulting in immediate termination.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — curiosity browsing bypasses progressive discipline.

### **MODULE 4: PATIENT IDENTITY VERIFICATION AND CALLER AUTHENTICATION (45 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Wrong-person disclosures are one of the most common PHI incidents. Verification prevents this: before disclosing PHI or granting access, confirm the requester is who they claim to be using approved factors (DOB, last-four SSN, verbal password, or other client-specific methods). Verification is scripted discipline — follow the script exactly, never skip steps even under pressure. If verification fails after three attempts, terminate interaction politely, do not hint at correct answers, document failure, and escalate.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* States purpose of verification at interaction start  
* Asks all required verification factors per client script  
* Does not hint at correct answers when factors mismatch  
* Terminates interaction after three failures per script  
* Documents verification outcome (pass/fail, factors used)  
* Never bypasses verification due to urgency or caller emotion

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Verification Factors:** Information elements used to confirm identity (DOB, last-four SSN, verbal password, account number with personal details, security questions). Client-specific factors need\_review per client policy.

**Wrong-Person Error:** Disclosing PHI to individual other than intended recipient due to identity verification failure.

**Refusal Script:** Pre-approved language for declining disclosure when verification fails, including explanation and alternatives offered.

**Three-Attempt Limit:** Standard maximum verification attempts before termination; prevents guessing attacks while allowing for honest errors.

**Verification Pass:** All required factors match records; interaction may proceed to disclosure decision (still requires authorization check per Module 2).

**Verification Fail:** One or more factors do not match; interaction terminates or limited alternatives offered (secure callback, written request).

**Verbal Password (needs\_review):** Optional patient-set password for phone verification; availability depends on client system capabilities.

**Security Questions (needs\_review):** Alternative verification method using pre-registered answers; client-specific availability and question sets need\_review.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Verify Patient Identity (Phone or In-Person)**

1. State purpose of verification professionally: "To protect your privacy, I need to verify your identity before we discuss your information."

2. Request first verification factor per client script (needs\_review for specific factors and order):

   * Common first factor: Full legal name  
   * Confirm: "Can you state your full name as it appears in our records?"  
3. Request second verification factor:

   * Common second factor: Date of birth (format: MM/DD/YYYY)  
   * Confirm: "Can you provide your date of birth?"  
4. Request third verification factor if required by client:

   * Common third factor: Last four digits of SSN OR account number OR verbal password (if set)  
   * Confirm: "Can you provide the last four digits of your Social Security number?" OR relevant factor  
5. Compare provided factors against system records:

   * All factors match exactly: verification passes → proceed to Module 2 disclosure decision  
   * Any factor does not match: provide one additional attempt for that factor  
   * After THREE TOTAL FAILED ATTEMPTS across all factors: terminate interaction  
6. If verification fails:

   * Do NOT hint at correct answers ("Your birthday is in March, not April")  
   * Do NOT provide partial information ("You're close")  
   * Use refusal script: "I'm unable to verify your identity using the information provided. For your security, I cannot proceed with this request over the phone. You have these alternatives: \[list alternatives per script\]."  
7. Alternatives to offer after verification failure:

   * Secure callback: "I can call you back at the phone number we have on file after you confirm that number."  
   * Secure portal: "You can access this information through our secure patient portal."  
   * In-person with ID: "You can visit our office with photo identification."  
   * Written request: "You can submit a written request with your signature."  
8. Document verification outcome in system/ticket:

   * Pass: "Identity verified using \[factors\]. Proceeded with \[disclosure/action\]."  
   * Fail: "Identity verification failed after \[X\] attempts. Interaction terminated. Offered alternatives: \[list\]. No disclosure occurred."

**Procedure: Verify Provider/Payer Caller Identity**

1. Request caller identification:

   * Name and role/title  
   * Organization name  
   * Department  
   * Callback number (official organizational number, not personal cell)  
2. Verify identity using client-approved method (needs\_review per client):

   * Method A: Callback to verified organizational number from records  
   * Method B: Verify caller ID matches organizational number \+ verify personal details  
   * Method C: Use provider/payer directory to confirm person and role  
   * Method D: Request faxback on organizational letterhead  
3. If verification method is unclear or caller resists: escalate to supervisor before disclosing

4. Document provider/payer verification: "Verified caller identity: \[Name\], \[Role\], \[Organization\]. Method: \[callback/caller ID verification/directory confirmation\]."

**Procedure: Handle Verification Failures (Script Discipline)**

**Attempt 1 Failure:** "Let me try that information again. Can you provide your \[factor\]?" \[If fails again, this is Attempt 2\]

**Attempt 2 Failure:** "That information still doesn't match our records. I have one more attempt before I need to end this call for security reasons. Can you carefully provide your \[factor\]?" \[If fails again, this is Attempt 3 — terminate\]

**Attempt 3 Failure (Termination):** "I'm unable to verify your identity with the information provided. For your security, I cannot share any information at this time. You can \[list alternatives from script\]. Is there anything else I can help with that doesn't require identity verification?"

\[End call professionally. Do NOT continue discussing the account or providing hints.\]

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if caller refuses to provide verification factors — cannot proceed without verification  
* Stop if caller provides conflicting information ("My DOB is March... no, April...") — potential fraud indicator, escalate  
* Stop if caller pressures you to skip verification ("This is urgent\!" "I've called before\!" "Just this once\!") — apply Rule 4, maintain requirement  
* Stop if verification factors are not working and you suspect system error — escalate to verify correct factors before continuing attempts

**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → Privacy officer (for unusual verification issues or fraud concerns)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Every verification attempt outcome documented (pass or fail)  
* Failed verification: number of attempts, alternatives offered, caller response  
* Verification factors used (record which factors, not the actual values provided)  
* Any fraud indicators or suspicious behavior

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- Clean Verification Pass:** **Caller:** "Hi, I need my test results." **Employee:** "I'd be happy to help. To protect your privacy, I need to verify your identity. Can you state your full name?" **Caller:** "Sarah Lee." **Employee:** "Thank you. Can you provide your date of birth?" **Caller:** "March 15, 1980." **Employee:** "And can you provide the last four digits of your Social Security number?" **Caller:** "5678." **Employee:** \[Checks system — all match\] "Thank you, I've verified your identity. Let me look up your test results." \[Proceeds with disclosure per Module 2\]

**Why Compliant:** Followed script exactly, verified all required factors before proceeding, documented verification pass.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Verification Failure with Proper Termination (Source Scenario 16):** **Caller:** "I need to schedule an appointment." **Employee:** "I can help with that. To access your account, I need to verify your identity. Can you state your full name?" **Caller:** "John Smith." **Employee:** "Thank you. Can you provide your date of birth?" **Caller:** "June 10, 1975." **Employee:** \[Checks system — DOB shows June 10, 1985\] "Let me try that date of birth again. Can you provide your date of birth?" **Caller:** "June 10, 1975." **Employee:** "That still doesn't match our records. I have one more attempt. Can you carefully provide your date of birth?" **Caller:** "I'm sure it's June 10, 1975." **Employee:** \[Three attempts exhausted\] "I'm unable to verify your identity with the information provided. For your security, I cannot access your account at this time. You can visit our office with photo identification, or you can call back with the correct information. Is there anything else I can help with?" **Caller:** "No." \[Call ends\] **Employee:** \[Documents: "Verification failed after 3 DOB attempts. Interaction terminated per script. No disclosure occurred."\]

**Why Compliant:** Followed three-attempt limit exactly, did not hint at correct answer (did not say "your birth year is 1985"), terminated per script, offered alternatives, documented completely, no disclosure occurred. Source Scenario 16 directly addresses this pattern.

**Non-Compliant Example:** **Caller:** "This is ridiculous\! I'm calling about my mother's surgery. It's scheduled for tomorrow and I need the time\!" **Employee:** "Okay, let me verify your identity first—" **Caller:** "I don't have time for this\! Just tell me the time\! She's 82 years old and we need to know\!" **Employee:** \[Feeling pressured\] "Alright, the surgery is at 7 AM. Make sure she's there by 6 AM for prep."

**Why Non-Compliant:** Multiple violations:

* Skipped identity verification entirely due to pressure (Rule 4 violation)  
* Did not verify caller is authorized to receive mother's information (Module 2 authorization requirement)  
* Disclosed surgery details to unverified, possibly unauthorized person  
* Wrong-person disclosure incident  
* Source patterns in Scenario 2 (family member without authorization) and Module 0 Rule 4 (pressure to bypass)  
* Result: incident report required, sanctions likely, potential breach if information went to wrong person

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Verification Script Repetition (10 Cooperative to Challenging Progression)**

Practice verification script with increasing difficulty (trainer plays caller, learner follows script):

**Round 1:** Cooperative caller, all factors match first attempt → PASS **Round 2:** Cooperative caller, DOB incorrect first attempt, correct second attempt → PASS **Round 3:** Caller provides incorrect DOB three times, polite → TERMINATE **Round 4:** Caller resistant to verification: "I've called before, you should know me\!" → Maintain script, proceed with verification or terminate **Round 5:** Caller provides conflicting information: "My DOB is... wait, let me check..." → Note inconsistency, proceed carefully or escalate if fraud indicator **Round 6:** Caller refuses to provide SSN: "I don't give that out." → Offer alternative factor or terminate if no alternative available **Round 7:** Caller pressures: "This is an emergency, skip the questions\!" → Apply Rule 4, maintain verification requirement **Round 8:** Wrong-number scenario: Caller verifies identity but asks about different patient → Terminate, explain cannot discuss other patients **Round 9:** Caller becomes angry during verification failure → Remain professional, maintain script, terminate at three attempts **Round 10:** Potential impersonator: Caller hesitates on factors, asks leading questions → Escalate for fraud concern

**Scoring:** 80% \= 8/10 rounds handled per script

**Scenario Exercise: Spouse Without Authorization (Source Scenario 2 Extension)** **Scenario:** Male caller: "This is Robert Chen. I need my wife Linda's mammogram results. We're married. Her DOB is May 5, 1978." You verify his identity as Robert Chen (DOB matches your system for an account under that name). He asks for Linda Chen's results.

**Question:** What is the verification issue and what do you do?

**Answer:** **Issue:** Robert verified his OWN identity, but he's asking for Linda's (someone else's) information. Verification of Robert's identity does not authorize disclosure of Linda's information. This requires authorization check per Module 2\.

**Response:** "Mr. Chen, I've verified your identity for your own account. However, to share Linda's information with you, I need authorization from Linda. Is Linda available to speak with me to authorize this disclosure, or she can complete an authorization form allowing us to share her information with you. I'm unable to share her results without her permission."

**If caller pressures:** "I understand you're married, but our policy requires each patient's explicit authorization before we share their information with others, including spouses. This protects everyone's privacy."

**Why Correct:** Distinguishes between verification (confirming who caller is) and authorization (permission to receive someone else's PHI). Source Scenario 2 directly addresses spouse request pattern.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Various callers  
 **Learner plays:** Employee applying verification script

**Simulation scored on:**

* Stating verification purpose at start  
* Following script exactly (no skipping factors)

* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (12 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Before disclosing PHI, you must verify: A) Caller's phone number only  
 B) Identity using approved factors  
 C) Caller's reason for calling  
 D) Supervisor approval

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Identity verification using approved factors is mandatory before PHI disclosure.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** How many verification attempts are typically allowed before termination? A) 1  
 B) 2  
 C) 3  
 D) Unlimited

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Three-attempt limit is standard to balance security with honest error allowance.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — unlimited attempts create guessing attack vulnerability.

**Item 3 (True/False):** If a caller becomes angry during verification, you should skip the questions to de-escalate.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Verification is mandatory regardless of caller emotion; Rule 4 applies to pressure.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — prioritizing de-escalation over security.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** When a caller fails verification, you should: A) Give hints to help them remember  
 B) Provide the correct information so they can try again  
 C) Not provide hints; terminate after three attempts  
 D) Transfer to supervisor to verify

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** No hints; hints compromise security and help potential impersonators.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "being helpful" compromises security.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Caller provides correct name and DOB but wrong SSN last-four three times. What do you do? A) Proceed since 2 out of 3 factors matched  
 B) Terminate per script; offer alternatives  
 C) Ask for different SSN format  
 D) Override and proceed since caller seems legitimate

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** All required factors must match; three failures trigger termination.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — partial match is not sufficient.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** "To protect your privacy, I need to verify your identity" is: A) Optional preamble  
 B) Required statement of verification purpose  
 C) Only needed for new patients  
 D) Only needed for sensitive information

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Stating verification purpose is required at interaction start.

**Item 7 (True/False):** If you've spoken to the caller before and recognize their voice, you can skip verification.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Voice recognition is not approved verification method; script required every time.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — "I know them" is not verification.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** After verification failure, you should offer: A) One more chance with easier questions  
 B) Alternatives (secure callback, portal, in-person, written request)  
 C) To speak to supervisor who might recognize them  
 D) To call them back without verification

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Script specifies offering alternatives after verification failure.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — no "easier questions" exist.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Caller says "I'm calling about my wife's appointment. Can you tell me the time?" What is the first verification step? A) Verify caller's identity  
 B) Verify wife's identity  
 C) Verify caller has authorization to receive wife's information  
 D) Just provide the appointment time

**Answer:** A and C (both needed)  
 **For MCQ format, best answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Caller is requesting someone else's PHI; requires both identity verification (who is caller) and authorization check (is caller authorized to receive wife's PHI per Module 2). If forced to choose one answer, authorization check (C) is the critical first failure point since caller is not the patient.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A only — verifying caller's identity is necessary but not sufficient; authorization required.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Verification factors typically include (client-specific): A) Favorite color and pet name  
 B) DOB, last-four SSN, account number  
 C) Email password  
 D) Credit card number

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** DOB, SSN last-four, account numbers are standard verification factors (needs\_review per client).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — these are too easily guessed or known by others.

**Item 11 (True/False):** If verification fails and the caller says "Can you just tell me if I'm close?" you should provide guidance.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Never provide hints about correctness or proximity; compromises security.

**Item 12 (Short Answer):** After three verification failures, what are three alternatives you should offer?

**Answer:** (Any three of: secure callback to number on file, secure patient portal access, in-person visit with photo ID, written request with signature)

**Rationale:** Standard alternatives after verification failure per script.

### **MODULE 5: REMOTE WORKSTATION SECURITY (PAKISTAN OPERATIONS) (90 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Remote work from home in Pakistan introduces physical security risks that office environments control automatically (locked doors, limited access, security guards). You are responsible for creating a secure workspace: screen angle and privacy filter preventing visual access, lock discipline (manual lock every absence, auto-lock enabled), no non-work persons in view/hearing of PHI, network discipline (only approved secure connections), and incident response (if workspace compromised, stop work, escalate, document). Home environment interruptions (family, visitors, power outages, shared devices) require specific protocols to maintain PHI security.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Positions screen to prevent viewing from windows, doors, common areas  
* Uses privacy filter on screen during work hours  
* Locks workstation manually before every absence (bathroom, breaks, end of shift)  
* Confirms auto-lock setting enabled (typically 5-15 minutes idle, needs\_review per client)  
* Mutes and pauses work immediately if non-work person enters visual/audio range of PHI  
* Uses only approved network connection methods (never public Wi-Fi or unsecured networks)  
* Reports any workspace compromise immediately  
* Maintains clean desk at end of shift (no PHI visible)

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Clean Screen:** No PHI visible on display; achieved by locking workstation, closing applications, or positioning away from unauthorized viewers.

**Clean Desk:** No PHI visible on physical workspace (no printed documents, sticky notes, notebooks with PHI); achieved by securing all documents in locked storage or shredding at end of shift.

**Privacy Filter:** Physical screen overlay limiting viewing angle, making screen content visible only directly in front, not from sides or behind. (needs\_review for client requirement; some clients require, others recommend)

**Visitor Protocol:** Procedure for handling unexpected non-work persons entering workspace during PHI handling (family members, delivery persons, neighbors, maintenance).

**VPN Discipline (needs\_review):** Use of virtual private network to secure connection to client systems. Client-specific VPN requirements and connection procedures need\_review.

**Public Wi-Fi Prohibition:** Absolute ban on connecting to client systems via coffee shops, libraries, airports, or other public networks regardless of VPN availability. Includes mobile hotspots from public locations.

**Workspace Compromise:** Any event where unauthorized person may have viewed, heard, or accessed PHI (screen visible to visitor, document seen, conversation overheard, device accessed).

**Secure Connection Methods (needs\_review):** Client-approved network connections; typically: dedicated home internet with password-protected router \+ VPN (if required), OR client-provided dedicated connection device. Specific requirements need\_review per client.

**Auto-Lock Setting:** System configuration causing workstation to lock automatically after specified idle period (typically 5-15 minutes, needs\_review per client).

**Manual Lock:** User-initiated immediate workstation lock via keyboard shortcut (typically Windows+L or Ctrl+Alt+Del \> Lock) before any absence.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Set Up Secure Remote Workspace (Initial Setup)**

1. **Select workspace location in home:**

   * Private room with door preferred (not open living area)  
   * Screen positioned facing wall (not facing window or door)  
   * Chair positioned to see door entry (aware of people entering)  
   * Away from windows where outsiders could view screen  
   * Separated from family common areas if possible  
2. **Physical security setup:**

   * Install privacy filter on screen per client requirement (needs\_review)  
   * Verify screen angle prevents viewing from doorway  
   * Remove or cover any reflective surfaces (mirrors, glass surfaces) that could reflect screen  
   * Ensure door can be closed during work hours  
   * If door cannot close: use room divider or screen to create visual barrier  
3. **Technical security setup:**

   * Verify network connection meets client requirements (needs\_review):  
     * Password-protected home router (change default router password)  
     * VPN installed and functioning if required  
     * Never use public Wi-Fi or neighbor's Wi-Fi  
   * Enable auto-lock setting per client requirement (verify time setting, typically 5-15 minutes)  
   * Set strong workstation password (per Module 6\)  
   * Test manual lock shortcut (Windows+L) for muscle memory  
4. **Document workspace setup:**

   * Take photos showing screen position, privacy filter, workspace boundaries  
   * Submit to supervisor for approval per onboarding requirement  
   * If workspace changes (moving to different room): repeat documentation

**Procedure: Daily Secure Workspace Discipline**

1. **Start of shift:**

   * Close and/or lock workspace door  
   * Notify household members you are starting work, interruptions should be minimized  
   * Position screen at secure angle  
   * Verify privacy filter in place (if required)  
   * Log in to systems  
2. **During work:**

   * Manual lock before EVERY absence (bathroom, kitchen, doorbell, phone call):  
     * Press Windows+L (or equivalent) BEFORE standing up  
     * Verify lock screen displayed  
     * Walk away  
   * If family member or visitor enters unexpectedly:  
     * Immediately mute audio if on call  
     * Press Windows+L to lock screen  
     * Pause work, address interruption  
     * Verify no PHI visible on screen after lock  
     * Resume only after interruption cleared  
   * If interruption cannot be cleared quickly (visitor staying, family needs assistance):  
     * Log out of systems if secure lock insufficient  
     * Notify supervisor of extended interruption if during active call/task  
     * Resume only when workspace secure again  
3. **Breaks and lunch:**

   * Manual lock BEFORE leaving workspace  
   * Close door if possible  
   * No PHI documents left visible on desk  
   * Verify screen locked before exiting room  
4. **End of shift:**

   * Log out of all systems  
   * Lock workstation  
   * Clean desk: all documents secured or shredded  
   * No sticky notes with PHI visible  
   * Close door to workspace  
   * Power down or lock computer per client requirement

**Procedure: Handle Workspace Compromise Incident**

**Compromise examples:**

* Family member saw screen before you locked  
* Visitor (delivery person, neighbor, maintenance) entered and may have viewed screen  
* Overheard PHI during your call (family member in adjacent room)  
* Screen visible through window to outside  
* Document left visible when someone entered

**Response steps:**

1. **Stop immediately:** If currently handling PHI, stop activity  
2. **Secure workspace:** Lock screen, secure any visible documents  
3. **Assess exposure:** What PHI may have been visible/audible? To whom?  
4. **Notify supervisor immediately:** Use secure communication channel (phone, secure message), describe what happened:  
   * "My \[family member/visitor\] entered workspace during \[call/screen display\] and may have seen \[patient account screen/document/heard conversation\]."  
   * Do NOT include patient identifiers in escalation message unless secure method  
5. **Document incident:**  
   * What happened, when, who may have seen/heard PHI, what PHI  
   * Immediate actions taken (locked screen, ended call, etc.)  
   * Follow Module 10 incident reporting procedure  
6. **Preserve evidence if needed:** Do not delete anything  
7. **Corrective actions:** Based on supervisor guidance, may include:  
   * Improved physical barriers (door lock, screen repositioning)  
   * Household re-education about workspace boundaries  
   * Workspace relocation  
   * Privacy filter installation if not already present

**Procedure: Handle Power Outages and Connection Issues**

1. **If power outage occurs during work:**

   * Systems will shut down (data loss depending on application)  
   * Notify supervisor as soon as possible after power restored  
   * Do NOT use public Wi-Fi or mobile hotspot from public location to reconnect  
   * Do NOT go to coffee shop or library to finish work  
   * Wait for home power restoration or follow client emergency work stoppage procedure  
2. **If internet connection fails:**

   * Troubleshoot per IT guidance (router restart, etc.)  
   * Notify supervisor of outage  
   * Do NOT use alternative unsecured connection  
   * Do NOT use neighbor's Wi-Fi or public hotspot  
3. **Document outage:**

   * Time of outage, duration, any work interruption impact

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if non-work person enters workspace while PHI visible — lock screen immediately  
* Stop if you cannot maintain workspace security (household emergency, construction workers entering home) — log out, notify supervisor  
* Stop if connection security is uncertain (network issues, VPN failure) — do not proceed until confirmed secure  
* Stop if privacy filter missing and client requires it — do not work until installed

**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → IT (for technical issues) / Compliance (for security incidents)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Workspace setup photos (initial and any changes)  
* Workspace compromise incidents documented fully per Module 10  
* Daily clean desk/clean screen compliance (verified through periodic supervisor spot checks)

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- Interruption Handling (Source Scenario 4 \- Family Member Entry):** Medical scribe is documenting provider dictation via video call. Family member (spouse) unexpectedly enters room to ask a question. Scribe immediately:

1. Mutes audio  
2. Presses Windows+L to lock screen  
3. Turns to family member: "I'm on a work call. Can this wait five minutes?"  
4. Family member leaves  
5. Scribe verifies screen locked (PHI not visible), resumes call  
6. Documents in end-of-shift note: "Brief interruption, family member entered workspace, workspace secured immediately, no PHI exposure"

**Why Compliant:** Immediate containment actions (mute, lock), prioritized PHI security over social courtesy, verified security before resuming, documented incident. Source Scenario 4 directly addresses this pattern.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Power Outage Response (Source Scenario 15 Context):** Employee experiencing scheduled power outage in area (announced by utility company). Employee:

1. Notifies supervisor start of shift: "Power outage scheduled 2-4 PM today. I will be offline during that time."  
2. During outage: does not attempt to continue work via alternative methods  
3. After power restored: reconnects via secure home network \+ VPN, resumes work  
4. Documents: "Power outage 2:03-3:47 PM, offline during that time, resumed via secure connection after restoration"

**Why Compliant:** Proactive notification, did not use unsecured alternatives (no public Wi-Fi, no mobile hotspot from public location), documented outage. Source Scenario 15 addresses network security discipline.

**Non-Compliant Example:** Employee works in shared living space (no door). Family members frequently walk through area. Employee has call with patient discussing diagnosis. Family member overhears conversation while getting water from kitchen. Employee continues call without interruption. Family member later mentions to neighbor that employee was talking about "someone's cancer diagnosis."

**Why Non-Compliant:** Multiple violations:

* Inadequate workspace setup (no privacy from family)  
* Failed to stop when family member entered hearing range  
* PHI overheard by unauthorized person  
* No incident reporting after recognizing family heard PHI  
* Workspace compromise incident occurred  
* Source patterns in Module 5 workspace security principles  
* Result: incident report required, possible workspace prohibition (may be required to work from supervised facility if home workspace cannot be secured), sanctions

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Workspace Security Checklist (Daily Practice)**

Complete checklist daily for first 30 days, then weekly:

**Setup verification:**

* \[ \] Screen facing away from window/door  
* \[ \] Privacy filter in place (if required)  
* \[ \] Door closed or visual barrier in place  
* \[ \] No reflective surfaces showing screen  
* \[ \] Auto-lock setting verified enabled

**During work:**

* \[ \] Manual lock before every absence practiced (Windows+L muscle memory)  
* \[ \] Family/household notified of work hours and boundaries  
* \[ \] No non-work persons in visual range of screen  
* \[ \] Secure network connection verified (home network \+ VPN if required)

**End of shift:**

* \[ \] All systems logged out  
* \[ \] Clean desk (no PHI visible)  
* \[ \] Screen locked or powered off  
* \[ \] Door closed to workspace

**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** You are on a call verifying benefits. Doorbell rings. Delivery person at door requires signature. What are your exact steps?

**Answer:**

1. Tell caller: "Please hold for one moment."  
2. Mute call immediately  
3. Press Windows+L to lock screen  
4. Verify lock screen displayed (no PHI visible)  
5. Go to door, handle delivery (keep it brief)  
6. Return to workspace, verify door closed  
7. Unlock screen (password entry)  
8. Unmute call  
9. Resume: "Thank you for holding. Where were we?"  
10. Document if any unusual delay: "Brief interruption for delivery, workspace secured per protocol"

**Why Correct:** Lock screen BEFORE absence, verify security, handle interruption briefly, resume through proper unlock.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Supervisor conducting workspace security audit (virtual)  
 **Learner plays:** Employee demonstrating workspace

**Trainer:** "I need to verify your workspace security setup. Can you show me your screen position relative to windows and doors?"

**Learner expected actions:**

* Use camera to show screen position (facing wall, not window)  
* Show privacy filter if required/installed  
* Explain household boundaries established  
* Demonstrate manual lock (Windows+L)  
* Show clean desk (no PHI visible)  
* Discuss typical interruption scenarios and handling

**Trainer evaluates:**

* \[ \] Interruption protocol understood (mute, lock, pause, resume)  
* \[ \] Incident response understood (stop, secure, escalate, document)  
* \[ \] Clean desk/screen protocol followed daily  
* \[ \] Workspace photos submitted and approved

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Physical setup: 3 points (screen position, privacy filter if required, door control)  
* Lock discipline: 2 points (manual and auto-lock)  
* Interruption handling: 2 points  
* Network security: 2 points  
* Incident response understanding: 1 point  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (15 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Before standing up from your workstation for any reason, you should: A) Tell someone where you're going  
 B) Lock workstation manually (Windows+L)  
 C) Turn off monitor  
 D) Log out of all systems

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Manual lock required before every absence, even brief ones.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — turning off monitor doesn't lock system; session remains active.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Privacy filter: A) Is optional convenience feature  
 B) Limits screen viewing angle to prevent shoulder surfing  
 C) Only needed in office settings  
 D) Replaces need for screen lock

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Privacy filter limits side/behind viewing angle for physical security.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — privacy filter supplements, does not replace, lock discipline.

**Item 3 (True/False):** If a family member enters your workspace unexpectedly during a call, you should finish your sentence before securing the workspace.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Immediate containment required (mute, lock) when non-work person enters.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — prioritizing conversation flow over security.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Public Wi-Fi use for client work is: A) Allowed if using VPN  
 B) Allowed if no PHI visible  
 C) Allowed in emergencies  
 D) Absolutely prohibited

**Answer:** D  
 **Rationale:** Public Wi-Fi prohibited regardless of VPN or content; security risk too high.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — VPN does not make public Wi-Fi acceptable.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Power outage at your home during work hours. What do you do? A) Go to coffee shop to continue work  
 B) Use mobile hotspot from library  
 C) Notify supervisor, wait for home power restoration  
 D) Use neighbor's Wi-Fi temporarily

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** No alternative unsecured connections allowed; wait for secure home connection restoration.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — coffee shop Wi-Fi is public and prohibited.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Clean desk at end of shift means: A) Tidy appearance  
 B) No PHI visible; all documents secured or shredded  
 C) Monitor off  
 D) Keyboard covered

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Clean desk \= no PHI visible on physical workspace.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "tidy" is not the security requirement; PHI removal is.

**Item 7 (True/False):** Auto-lock setting eliminates the need for manual locking before absences.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Manual lock required before every absence; auto-lock is backup for forgotten manual locks.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — relying solely on auto-lock leaves exposure during absence before timer triggers.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** If you realize a family member saw your screen before you locked it, you should: A) Do nothing if they didn't say anything  
 B) Immediately report as workspace compromise incident  
 C) Only report if they saw sensitive diagnoses  
 D) Ask them not to tell anyone

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Any potential PHI exposure is reportable incident, regardless of content type or outcome.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "didn't say anything" doesn't eliminate incident reporting requirement.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Your screen position faces a window where neighbors could potentially see if looking. What do you do? A) Keep working; unlikely anyone is looking  
 B) Reposition screen immediately to face wall, not window  
 C) Close blinds and continue  
 D) Only worry about it during daytime

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Screen must be positioned to prevent any external viewing possibility; repositioning is required.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — blinds can open or be imperfect; positioning is primary control.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Workspace compromise incident requires: A) Stop work, secure workspace, notify supervisor immediately, document  
 B) Continue working and mention at end of shift  
 C) Only report if patient complains  
 D) Report only if you're certain PHI was seen

**Answer:** A  
 **Rationale:** Immediate response required: stop, secure, escalate, document.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — report potential exposure, not just confirmed exposure.

**Item 11 (True/False):** If your home internet is down, you can use your phone's mobile hotspot to continue work.

**Answer:** False (needs clarification based on client policy)  
 **Rationale:** Generally prohibited; mobile hotspots may not meet security requirements (needs\_review per client). If client explicitly allows secure mobile hotspots, answer may differ, but default is prohibition of alternative connections.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — assuming mobile hotspot is acceptable alternative.

**Item 12 (MCQ):** Manual lock keyboard shortcut (Windows) is: A) Ctrl+Alt+Del  
 B) Windows+L  
 C) Alt+F4  
 D) Ctrl+L

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Windows+L is standard Windows lock shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+Del also accesses lock option but requires additional click).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — Ctrl+Alt+Del brings up security options menu, not immediate lock.

**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** You work in a room with a door. Your spouse knocks and opens door during your call. What do you do FIRST? A) Tell spouse to wait  
 B) Mute call and lock screen (Windows+L) immediately  
 C) Cover screen with paper  
 D) End call

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Immediate containment (mute \+ lock) is first action, before addressing person.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — securing workspace takes priority over social response.

**Item 14 (Short Answer):** List three physical security elements required for secure home workspace setup.

**Answer:** (Any three of: screen positioned away from window/door, privacy filter installed if required, door that closes or visual barrier, no reflective surfaces showing screen, separation from family common areas)

**Rationale:** Physical controls prevent unauthorized viewing.

**Item 15 (MCQ):** Clean screen means: A) Dust-free monitor  
 B) No PHI visible on display (locked or closed)  
 C) Screen protector installed  
 D) Brightness adjusted

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Clean screen \= no PHI visible, achieved through locking or closing applications.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — physical cleanliness is not the security definition.

### **MODULE 6: AUTHENTICATION, PASSWORDS, AND MFA (60 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Authentication is how systems confirm you are who you claim to be. Strong authentication prevents account compromise: follow exact client IAM (Identity and Access Management) rules (needs\_review for password requirements, rotation cadence, and MFA methods per client), enroll MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) in approved method with backup codes stored securely, never share credentials under any circumstance (includes during emergencies or to "help" colleagues), respect session timeouts (re-authenticate after timeout, never bypass), and report any suspected compromise immediately. Password rotation cadence and exact controls need\_review against current standard and client IAM because NIST 800-63B guidance has evolved.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Creates passwords meeting client-specific complexity requirements  
* Enrolls MFA during onboarding and maintains enrollment  
* Never shares credentials (username, password, MFA codes) with anyone  
* Respects session timeouts; re-authenticates without complaint  
* Uses password manager only if client-approved (needs\_review)  
* Reports suspected account compromise immediately (unusual login alerts, forgotten logins, suspicious activity)

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Authentication:** Process of verifying user identity before granting system access.

**Credential:** Information used to authenticate (username \+ password, biometrics, security token, MFA codes).

**MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Security method requiring two or more verification factors: something you know (password), something you have (phone, token, smart card), something you are (fingerprint, face recognition).

**Credential Sharing:** Providing your login credentials to another person or using another person's credentials. Absolutely prohibited; results in immediate termination under acceleration clause.

**Session Timeout:** Automatic logout after period of inactivity (typically 15-30 minutes, needs\_review per client). Requires re-authentication to resume work.

**Password Manager (needs\_review):** Software storing encrypted passwords; reduces need to memorize multiple complex passwords. Client approval required before use; some clients prohibit, others require specific approved tools.

**Password Complexity Requirements (needs\_review):** Client-specific rules for password creation (length, character types, prohibited patterns). Common requirements: 12+ characters, mix of uppercase/lowercase/numbers/symbols, no dictionary words, no personal information. Exact requirements need\_review per client IAM policy.

**Password Rotation/Expiration (needs\_review):** Frequency of required password changes. NIST 800-63B current guidance discourages mandatory periodic rotation without cause; however, client policies vary and may require rotation (30-90 days common historically). Exact client requirements need\_review.

**Backup Codes:** One-time use codes generated during MFA enrollment for emergency access if primary MFA method unavailable (phone lost, token broken). Must be stored securely (not in plain text on device).

**Account Compromise:** Unauthorized access to user account due to stolen credentials, phishing, malware, or credential sharing.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Enroll MFA During Onboarding**

1. Receive MFA enrollment instructions from IT during onboarding

2. Identify client-approved MFA method (needs\_review per client; common methods: authenticator app, SMS codes, hardware token, biometric)

3. Follow enrollment steps for approved method:

    **For Authenticator App (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator):**

   * Install approved authenticator app on personal phone  
   * Scan QR code displayed during enrollment  
   * Enter verification code generated by app to confirm enrollment  
   * Note: phone must be accessible during every login  
4. **For SMS Codes:**

   * Provide verified phone number  
   * Receive test code via SMS  
   * Enter code to confirm enrollment  
   * Update phone number immediately if it changes  
5. **For Hardware Token:**

   * Receive physical token from IT  
   * Test token code entry during enrollment  
   * Store token securely; bring to work daily  
6. Generate and securely store backup codes:

   * System generates 10-12 backup codes during enrollment  
   * Print backup codes OR write down and store in secure location (NOT on device, NOT in email)  
   * Each backup code works once only  
   * Recommended: store in home safe or locked drawer, separate from device  
7. Verify MFA enrollment successful:

   * Log out completely  
   * Log back in using password \+ MFA method  
   * If successful: enrollment complete  
   * If unsuccessful: contact IT immediately for troubleshooting  
8. Document MFA enrollment completion in training record

**Procedure: Daily Authentication Discipline**

1. **Login at start of shift:**

   * Enter username  
   * Enter password (do not save password in browser unless client-approved password manager policy permits)  
   * Complete MFA prompt (enter code from app, SMS, or token)  
   * Verify successful login to all required systems  
2. **During work session:**

   * Do not walk away leaving session unlocked (manual lock per Module 5\)  
   * If session timeout occurs during work:  
     * Save work if possible before timeout  
     * Re-authenticate through login screen  
     * Resume work  
   * Do NOT attempt to bypass or extend session timeout  
   * Do NOT share screen while password visible during login  
3. **End of shift:**

   * Log out of all systems manually (do not rely on auto-logout)  
   * Confirm logout completed before closing applications

**Procedure: Handle Credential Sharing Requests (Always Refuse)**

**Scenario A: Colleague asks to borrow login** Response: "I cannot share my credentials. That violates our security policy and puts both of us at risk. If you need system access, please contact IT for your own credentials \[or password reset\]."

**Scenario B: Supervisor asks for password "just this once"** Response: "I need to follow our credential policy and cannot share my password. Can I help you with the task directly, or we can escalate to IT for proper access?" If supervisor insists: "I need to escalate this request to \[compliance/HR\] to confirm this is an approved exception." \[Then escalate immediately per safe stop Rule 4\]

**Scenario C: Colleague's account locked, asks to use yours to meet deadline** Response: "I can't share my credentials. Let me help you contact IT for an emergency unlock. Usually takes 10-15 minutes." Do NOT offer your login as temporary solution.

**Scenario D: IT or supervisor requests password over phone/email** Response: "Our policy is that I never provide my password to anyone, including IT or supervisors. Can you verify this is a legitimate request through \[proper IT ticket channel/official company directory\]?" Legitimate IT never asks for your password; if request persists, escalate to security/compliance.

**Procedure: Respond to Suspected Account Compromise**

**Warning signs of compromise:**

* Login alert from unfamiliar location/device  
* System shows active session you don't recognize  
* Password no longer works (changed without your action)  
* Unusual activity in your account history (emails sent, files accessed)  
* MFA codes requested that you didn't initiate

**Response steps:**

1. **Stop work immediately**  
2. **Change password immediately** if you can still log in:  
   * Use password reset process  
   * Create completely new password (do not reuse old password with minor changes)  
   * Verify MFA still enrolled correctly  
3. **If you cannot log in** (password changed by attacker):  
   * Contact IT immediately for emergency password reset  
   * Do NOT attempt multiple failed login attempts  
4. **Report to supervisor immediately:** "I suspect my account may be compromised. I've changed my password \[or cannot log in\]. Please log this as a security incident."  
5. **Document incident:**  
   * What you observed (login alert, failed password, unusual activity)  
   * When you first noticed  
   * Actions taken (password changed, IT contacted)  
   * Follow Module 10 incident reporting procedure  
6. **Cooperate with investigation:**  
   * IT may review login history  
   * May require additional authentication steps  
   * Do not delete any suspicious emails or activity evidence

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if anyone asks for your password — never provide, escalate  
* Stop if session timeout frustrates you — do not seek bypass; re-authenticate properly  
* Stop if MFA enrollment fails — contact IT before attempting workarounds  
* Stop if you suspect account compromise — change password, escalate immediately

**Escalation Path:** IT helpdesk → IT security → Compliance (for credential sharing or compromise incidents)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* MFA enrollment verification recorded in training record  
* Credential sharing refusals documented if pressure occurred (incident report per Module 10\)  
* Account compromise incidents documented fully (Module 10 procedure)

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- MFA Enrollment:** New hire receives enrollment email from IT: "Complete MFA enrollment by end of Day 1." Employee:

1. Installs Microsoft Authenticator app on personal phone  
2. Scans QR code from enrollment portal  
3. Tests code entry successfully  
4. Generates backup codes, prints them, stores in home desk drawer  
5. Logs out and back in successfully using password \+ MFA code  
6. Confirms to IT: "MFA enrollment complete"  
7. Training record updated with MFA enrollment verification timestamp

**Why Compliant:** Completed enrollment per instructions, stored backup codes securely (not on device), verified enrollment functionality, documented completion.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Credential Sharing Refusal (Source Scenario 13):** Colleague urgently requests: "My account is locked and I need to process this claim today. Can I use your login for 10 minutes? I'll log you out when done."

Employee response: "I can't share my credentials — that's against our policy and could get us both terminated. Let me help you contact IT for an emergency unlock. Usually takes about 15 minutes. Do you have IT's number?"

Colleague: "This is urgent\! I'll lose my bonus if I miss this deadline\!"

Employee: "I understand the urgency, but I still can't share my login. Let's get IT on the phone right now together." \[Helps colleague contact IT, documents pressure attempt in end-of-shift note\]

**Why Compliant:** Refused credential sharing despite urgency and peer pressure, offered proper alternative (IT unlock), remained helpful without violating policy, documented pressure attempt. Source Scenario 13 directly addresses credential sharing pressure pattern.

**Non-Compliant Example:** Supervisor to employee: "I need to review some accounts and my login isn't working. What's your password? I'll just use yours quickly."

Employee: "Okay, it's MyP@ssw0rd123. Log out when done."

Two days later: Audit discovers supervisor accessed accounts outside their authorization using employee's credentials. Investigation traces unauthorized access to employee's account. Both supervisor and employee terminated under acceleration clause (supervisor for unauthorized access \+ credential misuse; employee for credential sharing).

**Why Non-Compliant:** Credential sharing is absolute prohibition with immediate termination consequence, even when requested by supervisor. Employee should have refused and helped supervisor contact IT for proper access or password reset. Source Scenario 13 and Module 6 explicitly prohibit credential sharing under any circumstance. Result: termination for both parties, possible regulatory report, potential breach if access was inappropriate.

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: MFA Enrollment Simulation (Hands-On)**

Using test system provided during training, complete MFA enrollment:

1. Access MFA enrollment portal with temporary credentials  
2. Choose authenticator app method  
3. Scan QR code with personal device (or test device if personal device unavailable)  
4. Enter verification code successfully  
5. Generate backup codes  
6. Store backup codes securely (demonstrate secure storage method to trainer)  
7. Log out and log back in using MFA  
8. If enrollment fails: troubleshoot with IT support simulation

**Scoring:** Must successfully complete all 8 steps to pass (100% required for security-critical task)

**Scenario Exercise: Credential Sharing Pressure**

For each scenario, provide exact response:

**Scenario 1:** "I'm working from home and forgot my password. Can you tell me yours so I can log in?" **Response:** "I cannot share my password. Contact IT at \[number\] for a password reset. It usually takes 5-10 minutes."

**Scenario 2:** "The client is on the phone waiting\! I need access NOW and IT is slow\! Just give me your login\!" **Response:** "I understand the urgency, but sharing credentials could get us both terminated. Let me help you escalate to IT for emergency support, or I can handle the client call if I have appropriate access."

**Scenario 3:** Supervisor: "This is a direct order. Give me your password." **Response:** "Our policy prohibits credential sharing even by supervisor direction. I need to escalate this request to \[compliance/HR\] to verify it's an approved exception." \[Then immediately escalate\]

**Scenario 4:** "We're a team\! We share everything. What's your password for the shared account?" **Response:** "Even for shared tasks, we each need our own credentials. Sharing credentials is prohibited and creates audit and security risks. Let's get you set up with your own access through IT."

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Colleague pressuring for credentials  
 **Learner plays:** Employee refusing and offering alternatives

**Round 1 \- Subtle Pressure:** **Trainer:** "Hey, can you log in for me on that system? I'm having issues and I'm slammed."

**Learner expected actions:**

* Refuse: "I can't use my credentials for someone else. What system are you having trouble with?"  
* Diagnose: "Is it a password issue or access issue?"  
* Direct to proper solution: "Contact IT for password reset" OR "Request access through access request form"  
* Do NOT log in on their behalf

**Round 2 \- Urgent Pressure:** **Trainer:** "This is URGENT\! Just tell me your password quickly\!"

**Learner expected actions:**

* Maintain refusal: "I cannot share my password under any circumstances, including urgent ones."  
* Offer alternative: "Tell me what you need done. If I have access, I can do it. Or we can escalate to IT for emergency support."  
* If pressure continues: Document pressure attempt, escalate to supervisor

**Round 3 \- Supervisor Pressure:** **Trainer (as supervisor):** "I need your password to review some records. This is an audit requirement."

**Learner expected actions:**

* Politely refuse: "Our policy prohibits password sharing. Can I help you access the records directly, or we can contact IT to provision audit access?"  
* If supervisor insists: "I need to verify with \[compliance/HR\] that this is an approved exception to the credential policy before I can provide my password."  
* Escalate immediately after interaction to compliance/HR

**Checklist: Authentication Discipline**

* \[ \] MFA enrolled and verified functional  
* \[ \] Backup codes generated and stored securely (not on device)  
* \[ \] Password meets client complexity requirements (needs\_review)  
* \[ \] Never shared credentials with anyone  
* \[ \] Respects session timeouts; re-authenticates without bypassing  
* \[ \] Logs out at end of shift manually  
* \[ \] Knows how to respond to credential sharing requests (refuse, offer alternative)  
* \[ \] Knows warning signs of account compromise  
* \[ \] Knows how to report suspected compromise (immediate password change, report to IT and supervisor)

**Scoring Rubric:**

* MFA enrollment completion: 3 points (must complete successfully)  
* Credential sharing refusal: 3 points (must refuse in all scenarios)  
* Session timeout understanding: 2 points  
* Compromise response: 2 points  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing; note MFA enrollment is 100% required but contributes to score)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (15 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** MFA requires: A) Very strong password only  
 B) Two or more verification factors  
 C) Biometric scan only  
 D) Security question answer

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** MFA \= multiple factors (something you know \+ something you have \+ something you are).

**Item 2 (MCQ):** You should share your password: A) With supervisors when requested  
 B) With IT when they ask over phone  
 C) With trusted colleagues in emergencies  
 D) Never, under any circumstance

**Answer:** D  
 **Rationale:** Credential sharing absolutely prohibited; no exceptions.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — supervisor requests do not override prohibition.

**Item 3 (True/False):** If your colleague's account is locked and they need urgent access, you can let them use your login temporarily.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Credential sharing prohibited even in urgent situations; direct colleague to IT for unlock.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — urgency does not excuse credential sharing (Source Scenario 13).

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Backup codes should be stored: A) In email for easy access  
 B) On your phone in photos  
 C) Securely separate from device (home safe, locked drawer)  
 D) In cloud storage

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Backup codes must be physically secure and separate from primary device.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — storing on phone defeats purpose if phone is lost/stolen.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Your session times out during work. What do you do? A) Try to bypass timeout using browser back button  
 B) Re-authenticate through login screen and resume  
 C) Contact IT to extend timeout setting  
 D) Use colleague's session on their computer

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Respect timeout; re-authenticate properly and resume work.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — attempting bypass violates session management controls.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Warning signs of account compromise include: A) Slow system performance  
 B) Login alert from unfamiliar location, password no longer works  
 C) Too many emails in inbox  
 D) Scheduled maintenance notice

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Unexpected login activity or password change indicates potential compromise.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — slow performance usually not compromise indicator.

**Item 7 (True/False):** Password managers are always allowed for storing work passwords.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Password manager use requires client approval (needs\_review per client); some prohibit, others require specific tools.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — assuming password managers are universally acceptable.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** If you suspect account compromise, you should: A) Wait to see if it happens again  
 B) Immediately change password, report to IT and supervisor  
 C) Just change password quietly  
 D) Monitor the situation for a few days

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Immediate response required: change password, escalate to IT and supervisor, document.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — reporting required, not just password change.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Supervisor orders: "Give me your password. That's a direct order." What do you do? A) Comply since it's a direct order  
 B) Refuse and escalate to compliance/HR immediately  
 C) Give password but document it  
 D) Negotiate a compromise

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Credential sharing prohibited even by supervisor order; escalate immediately.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — orders do not override security policy.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Session timeout exists to: A) Annoy users  
 B) Prevent unauthorized access to abandoned sessions  
 C) Save system resources  
 D) Force password changes

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Session timeout security control prevents access if user forgets to log out or lock.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — resource saving is minor benefit, not primary purpose.

**Item 11 (True/False):** Legitimate IT staff will sometimes ask for your password over phone or email to troubleshoot issues.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** IT never needs your password; they can reset it but should never ask for it.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — not understanding that IT has administrative access and doesn't need user passwords.

**Item 12 (MCQ):** After MFA enrollment, you should: A) Delete backup codes since you have the app  
 B) Share backup codes with supervisor for safety  
 C) Store backup codes securely separate from device  
 D) Email backup codes to yourself

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Backup codes must be physically secure and separate from primary MFA device.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — backup codes needed if primary MFA method fails.

**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** You receive email: "Your password expires in 24 hours. Click here to reset." What do you do? A) Click link and reset password  
 B) Suspect phishing; do not click; verify through official IT channel or login portal directly  
 C) Reply asking if email is legitimate  
 D) Forward to colleague to check

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Password reset phishing common; verify through official channels, never click links in unexpected emails.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — clicking link without verification is phishing vulnerability.

**Item 14 (Short Answer):** What are the three types of authentication factors in MFA?

**Answer:**

1. Something you know (password, PIN)  
2. Something you have (phone, token, smart card)  
3. Something you are (fingerprint, face recognition, biometric)

**Rationale:** MFA combines multiple factor types for stronger security.

**Item 15 (MCQ):** Credential sharing typically results in: A) Verbal warning  
 B) Written warning  
 C) Immediate termination under acceleration clause  
 D) Mandatory retraining

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Credential sharing is high-severity violation triggering immediate termination.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — not understanding severity of credential sharing.

### **MODULE 7: EMAIL, MESSAGING, AND COMMUNICATION HYGIENE (75 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Most real PHI incidents are communication mistakes: wrong recipient (auto-complete error, reply-all), wrong channel (SMS, WhatsApp, personal email instead of approved channels), too much detail (diagnosis in subject line, full medical history in body when only appointment time needed). This module trains PHI-safe subject lines (use generic subjects from approved library, never put patient identifiers or diagnoses in subject), channel discipline (approved platforms only; SMS/WhatsApp/personal email/social media/unapproved chat banned for PHI), recipient verification (check To/CC/BCC, confirm thread history, verify email domain), and escalation when channel approval uncertain.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Writes subject lines from approved generic library  
* Verifies recipient identity and email address before sending PHI  
* Checks entire thread history before forwarding or replying  
* Uses only approved channels for PHI communication  
* Escalates immediately if uncertain about channel approval  
* Applies minimum necessary in email body (limits PHI to what recipient needs)

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Approved Channels:** Client-approved communication platforms for PHI handling (typically: client email system, secure portal, approved encrypted email, secure fax to verified number, secure provider portal, approved internal messaging systems). Specific approved list needs\_review per client.

**Banned Channels:** Communication platforms prohibited for PHI regardless of encryption or convenience (source list): SMS/text messages, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, personal email (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.), Twitter/X, Instagram, LinkedIn messaging, Telegram, Signal, Slack (unless client explicitly approves for specific client), unapproved chat applications, personal devices without MDM (Mobile Device Management).

**Auto-Complete Risk:** Email client suggests recipient based on first few letters; risk of selecting wrong recipient with similar name or email address.

**Reply-All Risk:** Responding to group email distribution includes all recipients, potentially disclosing PHI to unintended recipients who don't need-to-know.

**Thread History:** Previous email messages included in forward or reply; may contain PHI from earlier in conversation even if current message is PHI-free.

**Subject Line Library:** Pre-approved generic subject lines that convey purpose without including PHI (examples: "Claim status update," "Benefits inquiry follow-up," "Authorization request," "Account update needed," "Question regarding process"). Stored as job aid for reference.

**Encryption (needs\_review):** Technology protecting email content in transit and at rest. Client-specific encryption requirements and methods need\_review (some clients require encrypted email for external recipients, automatic encryption within system, or manual encryption selection).

**Email Domain Verification:** Confirming recipient email address domain matches expected organization (e.g., @clientorg.com for client staff, @insurancecompany.com for payer).

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Compose PHI-Safe Email**

1. **Before starting email:**

   * Confirm purpose: what specific information does recipient need?  
   * Confirm recipient: who exactly needs this information and why?  
   * Confirm channel: is email approved for this recipient and content type? (needs\_review per client)  
2. **Subject line discipline:**

   * Access subject line library job aid (approved generic subjects)  
   * Select appropriate generic subject from library:  
     * "Claim follow-up" NOT "John Doe's cancer treatment claim"  
     * "Benefits question" NOT "Sarah Lee diabetes coverage"  
     * "Authorization update" NOT "MRI authorization for patient \#123456"  
     * "Account inquiry" NOT "Payment question for Mary Johnson DOB 3/15/80"  
   * If no appropriate generic subject exists: create one without PHI and submit to supervisor for approval to add to library  
   * NEVER include patient name, MRN, diagnosis, account details, or any identifier in subject line  
3. **Recipient verification checklist (critical step):**

   * Type first few letters of recipient name/email  
   * STOP and carefully review auto-complete suggestions  
   * Verify correct recipient selected (check full email address, not just name display)  
   * Verify email domain matches expected organization (e.g., @clientorg.com NOT @gmail.com)  
   * For external recipients: verify organization is appropriate recipient for this PHI  
   * Check To vs CC vs BCC:  
     * To: Primary recipients who need to act  
     * CC: Recipients who need awareness (verify each has need-to-know)  
     * BCC: Rarely used; verify policy allows BCC for intended purpose  
   * If reply-all button clicked: verify all recipients have need-to-know for your response content  
4. **Compose body with minimum necessary:**

   * Start with greeting  
   * State purpose clearly  
   * Include only minimum necessary PHI:  
     * Use account number or MRN (needed for record identification)  
     * Avoid patient name if identifier already provided  
     * Avoid diagnosis or clinical details unless essential for stated purpose  
     * Use generic descriptions: "patient contacted regarding outstanding balance" NOT "patient with diabetes called about unpaid insulin claim"  
   * Provide next steps or required actions  
   * Professional closing  
5. **Attachment discipline:**

   * Attach only files recipient needs (not entire folder)  
   * Verify attachments contain only minimum necessary PHI  
   * Check file names: avoid PHI in file name itself ("Account\_789\_statement.pdf" NOT "John\_Doe\_medical\_bill.pdf")  
   * If client requires: encrypt attachments or use password protection (needs\_review)  
6. **Thread history review (before forward or reply):**

   * Scroll down and read entire thread history  
   * Identify PHI in previous messages  
   * Assess: Does new recipient need to see that historical PHI?  
   * If no: copy only relevant text to new email (do not forward full thread)  
   * If yes and historical PHI is excessive: redact unnecessary PHI from thread before forwarding  
7. **Final verification before sending:**

   * Re-read recipient email addresses (all To/CC/BCC)  
   * Re-read subject line (PHI-free?)  
   * Re-read body (minimum necessary?)  
   * Verify attachments correct  
   * Click Send  
8. **If error realized after sending:**

   * Attempt recall if client system supports (Outlook recall feature)  
   * Immediately escalate to supervisor: "I sent email with PHI to wrong recipient. Attempting recall. Please log incident."  
   * Follow Module 10 incident response procedure  
   * Do NOT delete sent email (preserve evidence)

**Procedure: Select Approved Communication Channel**

**Decision tree for channel selection:**

1. **Identify recipient type:**

   * Internal colleague (client employee): Client email system typically approved  
   * External provider: Secure provider portal, encrypted email, or secure fax (needs\_review per client)  
   * Payer: Secure payer portal, encrypted email, or secure fax (needs\_review per client)  
   * Patient: Secure patient portal, encrypted email (if patient enrolled), phone for discussion (with verification), postal mail  
   * Other: Escalate for guidance  
2. **For each recipient type, verify channel approval:**

   * Check approved channel list for client (needs\_review job aid)  
   * If channel not on approved list: STOP, do not use, escalate for approval or alternative  
3. **Common scenarios:**

   * "Can I text patient appointment reminder?" → NO if text includes PHI; YES if generic reminder only ("You have appointment tomorrow at 2 PM" acceptable if no diagnosis/provider name; "Your diabetes appointment with Dr. Smith" is PHI)  
   * "Can I email provider using their Gmail?" → Generally NO; use official provider portal or secure email to provider's professional email  
   * "Can I use WhatsApp to send colleague a patient question?" → NO; use client email system or approved internal messaging  
   * "Can I discuss patient information on Slack?" → Only if Slack is client-approved platform for internal communication (needs\_review per client)  
4. **If uncertain about channel approval:**

   * STOP (safe stop Rule 2\)  
   * Escalate to supervisor: "I need to communicate \[type of information\] to \[recipient type\]. Is \[proposed channel\] approved?"  
   * Wait for confirmation before proceeding  
   * Do NOT assume channel is acceptable because it's convenient or commonly used

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if subject line contains patient identifiers or diagnosis — rewrite with generic subject  
* Stop if recipient auto-complete shows multiple similar options — carefully verify correct recipient  
* Stop if uncertain whether channel is approved — escalate before sending  
* Stop if you notice PHI in thread history before forwarding — redact or copy text to new email

**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → IT (for technical channel questions) / Privacy officer (for policy interpretation)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* PHI-containing emails automatically logged by system (audit trail)  
* Wrong recipient incidents documented immediately per Module 10  
* Channel approval questions documented in escalation ticket

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- PHI-Safe Email:** **To:** benefits.coordinator@clientorg.com \[verified correct recipient\]  
 **Subject:** Benefits verification request \[from approved library\]  
 **Body:** "Hi \[Name\],

Requesting benefits verification for account \#789456. Authorization needed for outpatient procedure scheduled 12/20. Please verify coverage and notify if pre-authorization required.

Let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks, \[Your Name\]"

**Why Compliant:** Generic subject (no PHI), verified recipient, minimum necessary body (account number only, no patient name or diagnosis), clear purpose, professional.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Email Rewrite Removing PHI:** **Original (non-compliant):** **Subject:** John Doe cancer treatment  
 **Body:** "John Doe, DOB 3/15/70, MRN 123456, diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer, needs authorization for chemotherapy starting next week."

**Rewritten (compliant):** **Subject:** Authorization request  
 **Body:** "Authorization requested for account MRN 123456\. Treatment start date scheduled for next week. Please confirm authorization status."

**Why Improved:** Subject now generic, removed patient name (MRN sufficient), removed diagnosis details (not needed if payer has MRN for lookup), still provides necessary information (MRN, timeline).

**Non-Compliant Example (Source Scenario 7 and Related Patterns):** **Situation:** Employee intends to email benefits coordinator Sarah.Johnson@clientorg.com. Types "Sarah" in recipient field. Auto-complete suggests:

* Sarah.Johnson@clientorg.com (correct)  
* Sarah.Jones@clientorg.com (different person, similar name)  
* Sarah\_Johnson@gmail.com (personal email)

Employee quickly clicks first auto-complete suggestion without verifying. Accidentally selects Sarah.Jones@clientorg.com. Email contains patient account details (MRN, name, diagnosis, claim information). Sends email.

One hour later, Sarah Jones (wrong recipient) replies: "I think you meant to send this to Sarah Johnson, not me. I don't work in benefits."

**Why Non-Compliant:** Failed recipient verification step, disclosed PHI to wrong internal person (no need-to-know). Source Scenario 7 addresses misdirected email pattern.

**Immediate response:**

1. Reply to Sarah Jones: "Please delete that email and do not forward. I've escalated this incident to my supervisor."  
2. Escalate to supervisor immediately: "I sent PHI email to wrong Sarah. Sarah Jones received instead of Sarah Johnson. Wrong Sarah has no need-to-know. She has been asked to delete. Please log incident."  
3. Follow Module 10 incident procedure  
4. Document carefully: auto-complete error, immediate discovery, containment attempted, escalated

**Result:** Incident documented, training refresher likely required on recipient verification, potential counseling depending on history. Demonstrates importance of recipient verification checklist.

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Subject Line Rewrite (10 Unsafe to Safe)**

Rewrite each non-compliant subject line using approved generic alternatives:

1. "Sarah Lee mammogram results" → "Test results available"  
2. "John Doe diabetes claim denied" → "Claim status update"  
3. "Patient \#123 hypertension medication question" → "Medication inquiry"  
4. "Mary Johnson DOB 3/15/80 appointment" → "Appointment confirmation"  
5. "Cancer treatment authorization approved" → "Authorization update"  
6. "Bob Smith's stroke rehab claim" → "Claim follow-up"  
7. "Jane Wilson psychiatric evaluation results" → "Evaluation follow-up"  
8. "Account 789 \- patient has COVID" → "Account inquiry"  
9. "Emergency: patient suicide risk" → "Urgent case coordination" \[AND use phone, not email\]  
10. "Re: Linda Chen's pregnancy complications" → "Patient follow-up"

**Scoring:** 80% \= 8/10 rewrites correct (removes all PHI, maintains general purpose)

**Scenario Exercise: Thread History Exposure** **Scenario:** You receive email from provider asking about authorization status for account 789\. You reply with status. Before sending, you notice thread history includes 5 previous emails discussing patient's diagnosis, treatment plan, and personal family situation (prior medical history questions). Does new recipient (provider) need all that thread history?

**Question:** What do you do?

**Answer:**

1. Assess: Provider asking about authorization status (needs authorization answer only, not medical history or personal details from thread)  
2. Do NOT forward full thread with reply  
3. Create new email:  
   * To: \[Provider email, verified\]  
   * Subject: Authorization status \- Account 789  
   * Body: "Authorization approved for account 789\. Valid dates: \[dates\]. Please let me know if you need additional information."  
4. Send new email WITHOUT thread history  
5. If provider needs historical context: they can request specific information, which you provide on minimum necessary basis

**Why Correct:** Removes unnecessary PHI from thread history, provides only what provider needs for current inquiry (authorization status), applies minimum necessary to historical emails.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** QA reviewer checking sent emails  
 **Learner plays:** Employee explaining email decisions

**Trainer:** "I'm reviewing your sent emails from last week. This email has subject 'Patient account question.' Can you walk me through your subject line choice?"

**Learner expected actions:**

* Explain: "I used generic subject from approved library because the original question involved patient account details. 'Patient account question' conveys purpose without including identifiers or diagnosis."  
* If trainer shows example with PHI in subject: Acknowledge error, explain correct approach (generic subject), commit to following subject line library

**Trainer:** "This email was sent to three recipients in CC field. How did you verify they all needed this information?"

**Learner expected actions:**

* Explain: "I verified each recipient's role: benefits coordinator needs claim info, supervisor needs status update for reporting, patient accounts needs billing context. All three have need-to-know for their specific tasks."  
* If trainer identifies recipient without need-to-know: Acknowledge error, explain should have used To for primary recipient only, CC only for those needing awareness with legitimate need-to-know

**Checklist: Email Communication Hygiene**

* \[ \] Channel confirmed approved for recipient and content type  
* \[ \] Subject line from approved library (no PHI in subject)  
* \[ \] Recipient email address verified carefully (not auto-complete error)  
* \[ \] Recipient domain verified (matches expected organization)  
* \[ \] To/CC/BCC checked (each recipient has need-to-know)  
* \[ \] Thread history reviewed before forward/reply  
* \[ \] Body contains minimum necessary PHI only  
* \[ \] Attachments contain minimum necessary PHI only  
* \[ \] File names do not contain PHI  
* \[ \] Final verification completed before clicking Send

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Subject line safety (10-item drill): 4 points (8/10 \= 80%)  
* Recipient verification procedure: 2 points  
* Channel selection: 2 points  
* Thread history handling: 2 points  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (15 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Which subject line is PHI-safe? A) "John Doe's test results"  
 B) "Claim status update"  
 C) "Patient \#123 diabetes medication"  
 D) "Sarah Lee MRN 456789"

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Generic subject without identifiers or diagnosis.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — includes diagnosis.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Banned channels for PHI include: A) Client email system  
 B) SMS, WhatsApp, personal email  
 C) Secure patient portal  
 D) Encrypted email

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** SMS, WhatsApp, personal email prohibited for PHI per source banned list.

**Item 3 (True/False):** If WhatsApp is encrypted, it's acceptable to send patient information via WhatsApp.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** WhatsApp is banned channel regardless of encryption.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — assuming encryption makes channel acceptable.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Before clicking Send on email with PHI, you must: A) Just click Send quickly  
 B) Verify recipient email address, subject PHI-free, body minimum necessary, attachments correct  
 C) Only check subject line  
 D) Get supervisor approval

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Final verification checklist required before sending.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "quickly" bypasses verification.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Auto-complete suggests two Sarah Johnsons with similar emails. What do you do? A) Pick the first one  
 B) Carefully verify full email address matches intended recipient  
 C) Send to both to be safe  
 D) Use different communication method

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Careful verification prevents auto-complete errors.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — picking first without verification is common error pattern (Source Scenario 7).

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Thread history should be reviewed before: A) Every email  
 B) Only forward or reply  
 C) Only external emails  
 D) Never necessary

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Thread history may contain PHI that new recipient doesn't need; review before forwarding/replying.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — thread history exposure is common incident cause.

**Item 7 (True/False):** You can put patient diagnosis in email subject line if the email is only going to internal staff.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Subject line should never contain PHI regardless of recipient; maintains consistency and prevents accidental external sends.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — "internal only" does not excuse PHI in subject.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** If you realize you sent email to wrong recipient after clicking Send, you should: A) Delete the sent email  
 B) Attempt recall, immediately escalate to supervisor, follow Module 10 incident procedure  
 C) Send follow-up asking recipient to ignore  
 D) Do nothing and hope they don't read it

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Immediate incident response: recall attempt, escalation, documentation, evidence preservation.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — deleting sent email destroys evidence.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Patient texts you: "What were my test results?" You should: A) Text back the results  
 B) Text back: "Results are normal"  
 C) Not respond via text; call patient or direct to secure portal  
 D) Text back: "Call us"

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** SMS prohibited for PHI; use approved channel (phone with verification or secure portal).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — even "normal" is PHI (health information); text remains inappropriate channel.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Approved subject line library exists to: A) Save time  
 B) Provide PHI-safe generic subjects to prevent identifiers in subject lines  
 C) Standardize formatting  
 D) Satisfy IT requirements

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Library provides pre-approved PHI-free subjects to prevent identifier exposure.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — purpose is security, not just efficiency.

**Item 11 (True/False):** If you're uncertain whether a communication channel is approved for PHI, you should try it once to test and see if it gets flagged.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Safe stop Rule 2: stop if channel approval uncertain, escalate before using.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — "testing" creates potential incident.

**Item 12 (MCQ):** Minimum necessary in email body means: A) Use smallest font  
 B) Include only PHI recipient needs for stated purpose  
 C) Never use patient names  
 D) Keep emails under 100 words

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Minimum necessary \= only what's needed for recipient's purpose.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — patient names may be necessary depending on purpose and recipient.

**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** You forward email thread to colleague. Thread contains 10 previous emails discussing patient's medical history. Colleague only needs current status. What should you have done? A) Forward full thread for complete context  
 B) Copy only relevant current status to new email, exclude historical PHI  
 C) Summarize entire thread in new email  
 D) Forward and mark as confidential

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Minimum necessary: provide only current status needed, not full historical thread.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "complete context" violates minimum necessary if not all needed.

**Item 14 (Short Answer):** List three banned channels for PHI.

**Answer:** (Any three from source list: SMS/text, WhatsApp, personal email Gmail/Yahoo/Hotmail, Facebook Messenger, Twitter/X, Instagram, LinkedIn messaging, Telegram, Signal, unapproved Slack, unapproved chat apps)

**Rationale:** Source provides explicit banned channel list.

**Item 15 (MCQ):** Reply-all button should: A) Always be used for transparency  
 B) Be used carefully after verifying all recipients need your response content  
 C) Never be used  
 D) Only be used for urgent messages

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Reply-all requires verification that all recipients have need-to-know for your content.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "transparency" doesn't override need-to-know requirement.

### **MODULE 8: PHISHING, SOCIAL ENGINEERING, AND MALWARE DEFENSE (60 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Remote work increases exposure to targeted scams: phishing emails trick you into clicking malicious links or providing credentials, social engineering manipulates you into bypassing controls, CEO fraud uses urgency and authority to pressure inappropriate actions. Defense requires systematic inspection (sender exact-match check, domain look-alike detection, link hover verification, attachment caution, urgency language recognition) and immediate reporting via established procedure (never forward suspicious items to colleagues "to ask if safe"). Most successful attacks exploit human trust and urgency rather than technical vulnerabilities.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Inspects every email using 12-point checklist before clicking links or opening attachments  
* Hovers over links to preview actual destination URL before clicking  
* Verifies sender domain exactly matches expected organization  
* Recognizes urgency/threat language as manipulation tactic  
* Reports suspicious items via official reporting channel immediately  
* Never clicks "just to see" or forwards suspicious items to colleagues  
* Applies phone-based social engineering verification (uses approved verification method from Module 4, never discloses PHI to unverified caller)

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Phishing:** Deceptive electronic message (email, text, chat) designed to steal credentials, install malware, or trick recipient into inappropriate actions. Common tactics: spoofed sender, urgent tone, requests for credentials/financial info, malicious links/attachments.

**Spear Phishing:** Targeted phishing attack customized for specific individual or organization using researched details (your name, role, recent projects, colleagues' names) to appear more legitimate.

**Social Engineering:** Psychological manipulation to bypass security controls; exploits trust, authority, urgency, helpfulness, or fear. Occurs via phone, email, in-person, or combination. Examples: impersonating IT requesting password, fake "supervisor" demanding urgent access, "vendor" requesting confidential information.

**CEO Fraud (Business Email Compromise):** Phishing pattern impersonating executive or authority figure making urgent request (wire transfer, credential disclosure, policy exception). Source identifies this as common pattern in healthcare remote work environments.

**Look-Alike Domain:** Domain name similar to legitimate organization but with subtle differences designed to deceive (examples: microsof**t**.com vs microsof**1**.com; clientname.com vs clientname-secure.com vs client-name.com). One character difference or added words/hyphens.

**Link Hover:** Previewing actual link destination URL by hovering mouse over hyperlink without clicking; reveals whether displayed text matches actual destination.

**Malware:** Malicious software (viruses, ransomware, spyware, trojans) designed to damage systems, steal data, or enable unauthorized access. Often delivered via email attachments or malicious links.

**Attachment Caution:** Scrutiny of unexpected attachments, especially executable files (.exe, .bat, .scr), Office documents with macros (.docm, .xlsm), compressed files (.zip, .rar), and files from unknown senders.

**Urgency/Threat Language:** Manipulation tactic using time pressure or fear ("Account will close in 24 hours\!" "Click immediately or lose access\!" "Verify now to avoid suspension\!"). Designed to bypass rational evaluation and trigger impulsive action.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Email Inspection Routine (12-Point Checklist \- Job Aid)**

Perform this inspection for EVERY email before clicking links, opening attachments, or responding with sensitive information:

**1\. Sender Address Exact-Match Check:**

* Click on sender name to reveal full email address  
* Verify domain EXACTLY matches expected organization  
* Example: legitimate \= support@microsoft.com; phishing \= support@micros0ft.com (zero instead of O)  
* If sender domain unexpected or unfamiliar: STOP, proceed to point 2

**2\. Domain Look-Alike Check:**

* Compare sender domain character-by-character with known legitimate domain  
* Watch for: single character substitutions (rn appearing as m, 0 vs O, 1 vs l), added words (microsoft-support.com), added hyphens (micro-soft.com), different TLDs (microsoft.net vs microsoft.com)  
* If ANY doubt about domain authenticity: STOP, report as suspicious

**3\. Greeting and Personalization:**

* Legitimate business emails typically use your name  
* Generic greetings ("Dear Customer," "Dear User," "Hello,") may indicate mass phishing  
* Lack of personalization alone insufficient to determine phishing, but increases suspicion

**4\. Subject Line and Body Tone:**

* Urgent language: "Immediate action required\!" "Your account will be suspended\!"  
* Threat language: "You will lose access," "Final notice," "Legal action"  
* Too-good-to-be-true: "You've won," "Unclaimed refund," "Free gift"  
* If tone creates pressure to act quickly: STOP, slow down, apply full checklist

**5\. Spelling and Grammar:**

* Professional organizations proofread; numerous errors suggest phishing  
* Watch for: obvious typos, awkward phrasing, inconsistent formatting  
* Note: some sophisticated phishing is well-written; absence of errors doesn't guarantee legitimacy

**6\. Link Hover and Destination Check:**

* Hover mouse over ANY link without clicking  
* Read actual destination URL in browser status bar or tooltip  
* Verify destination domain matches displayed text and expected organization  
* Example: Link text says "microsoft.com" but hover shows "malicioussite.ru" \= PHISHING  
* If link destination doesn't match expectation or text: DO NOT CLICK

**7\. Attachment Caution:**

* Were you expecting this attachment?  
* Do you know the sender personally and did they tell you they were sending this?  
* File type: Executables (.exe, .bat, .scr, .com), macro-enabled Office docs (.docm, .xlsm), compressed files (.zip, .rar, .7z) are high-risk  
* File name: Does file name make sense for the purported purpose?  
* If unexpected attachment from unknown or suspicious sender: DO NOT OPEN, report

**8\. Requests for Credentials or Sensitive Information:**

* Legitimate IT never asks for passwords via email  
* Legitimate organizations never request SSN, credit card, account credentials via unsolicited email  
* Any email requesting login credentials, password, financial information, or personal data: STOP, verify through separate trusted channel (call official number, not number in email)

**9\. Sense of Urgency or Pressure:**

* "Act now\!" "Within 24 hours\!" "Immediately\!" "Before it's too late\!"  
* Urgency is manipulation tactic designed to prevent careful evaluation  
* If feeling rushed: STOP, slow down, apply all checklist points, consult supervisor if needed

**10\. Sender Legitimacy Verification:**

* Can you verify sender through separate channel?  
* For internal colleagues: confirm via phone, secure chat, or in-person  
* For external organizations: call official published number (not number in suspicious email), ask if they sent communication  
* If cannot verify: treat as suspicious

**11\. Context and Expectation:**

* Does this email make sense in context of your work?  
* Were you expecting communication from this sender about this topic?  
* Does request align with sender's normal role and communication patterns?  
* If out-of-context or unexpected: increase suspicion level

**12\. "Too Good to Refuse" or "Too Bad to Ignore":**

* Offers that seem extraordinarily beneficial (free money, prizes, unusual benefits)  
* Threats that seem catastrophic (account closure, legal action, data loss)  
* Both extremes are manipulation tactics  
* If email is at either extreme: HIGH suspicion, report

**Inspection Decision After Checklist:**

* **SAFE:** All checklist points pass, sender verified, context appropriate → Proceed with caution  
* **SUSPICIOUS:** One or more red flags → DO NOT CLICK/OPEN; report immediately  
* **UNCERTAIN:** Cannot definitively determine → Report to IT/security for evaluation

**Procedure: Report Suspicious Items (Never Forward to Colleagues)**

1. **Do NOT:**

   * Click any links in suspicious email to "see where it goes"  
   * Open any attachments to "check if it's safe"  
   * Forward to colleagues asking "Is this legitimate?" (spreads phishing to more people)  
   * Reply to sender asking if email is legitimate (confirms active email address to attacker)  
   * Delete immediately without reporting (prevents security team analysis)  
2. **Do:**

   * Use official reporting method per client (needs\_review):  
     * Method A: Forward to dedicated phishing report email (e.g., phishing@clientorg.com)  
     * Method B: Use "Report Phishing" button in email client if available  
     * Method C: Create IT security ticket with email forwarded as attachment  
   * Include in report: full email with headers (sender, date, subject)  
   * Notify supervisor: "I received suspicious email and reported via \[method\]. I did not click anything."  
   * If you already clicked before recognizing: Report immediately as potential compromise per Module 6  
3. **After reporting:**

   * Delete suspicious email from inbox after confirmation IT received report  
   * Watch for similar attempts (attackers often send waves)  
   * If colleagues ask about similar email: direct them to report via official channel, do NOT forward your copy

**Procedure: Phone-Based Social Engineering Defense**

**Common phone social engineering scenarios:**

* "IT helpdesk" requesting password for "system upgrade"  
* "Supervisor" requesting urgent information transfer  
* "Vendor" requesting confidential contract or patient information  
* "Colleague" from different location asking for credentials or system access

**Defense steps:**

1. **Apply verification from Module 4:**

   * Do not provide information or credentials based on caller claim alone  
   * Request callback number and verify through official directory  
   * If "IT": hang up, call official IT helpdesk number to verify request  
   * If "supervisor": hang up, call supervisor's known number to verify  
   * If "vendor": verify through contract or vendor registry, return call to known official number  
2. **Never provide credentials over phone:**

   * Legitimate IT never needs your password  
   * If caller requests password: refuse, report as social engineering attempt  
3. **Recognize pressure tactics:**

   * Urgency: "We need this now or systems will fail\!"  
   * Authority: "This is \[executive name\], I'm ordering you\!"  
   * Intimidation: "You'll be fired if you don't comply\!"  
   * Helpfulness exploitation: "I'm in crisis, please help\!"  
   * If experiencing pressure: STOP, apply safe stop Rule 4, verify independently  
4. **Document and report:**

   * After suspicious call: document caller details (claimed name/role/organization, callback number provided, request made)  
   * Report to IT security and supervisor  
   * "I received call from person claiming to be \[X\] requesting \[Y\]. I refused and am reporting for awareness."

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if email sender domain looks even slightly unfamiliar — verify before proceeding  
* Stop if email requests credentials or urgent action — verify through separate channel  
* Stop if feeling rushed to click/respond — slow down, apply full checklist  
* Stop if caller requests password or PHI without proper verification — hang up, verify independently

**Escalation Path:** IT security (for suspicious emails/calls) → Supervisor (for awareness) → Compliance (if credentials disclosed or link clicked)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Suspicious email reports documented automatically when reported to IT  
* Social engineering call attempts documented in IT security ticket  
* If compromised (clicked link, opened attachment, disclosed credentials): Module 6 compromise response \+ Module 10 incident response

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- Phishing Detection (Source Scenario 3 \- Look-Alike Domain):** Employee receives email: **From:** support@micros0ft.com (note: zero instead of O in microsoft) **Subject:** Urgent: Verify Your Account **Body:** "Your Microsoft Office 365 account requires immediate verification. Click here to verify within 24 hours or account will be suspended. \[Link\]"

Employee applies checklist:

1. Sender address check: reveals micros0ft.com (zero instead of O) — RED FLAG  
2. Domain look-alike: legitimate is microsoft.com, this is micros0ft.com — PHISHING  
3. Urgency language: "immediate," "24 hours," "suspended" — manipulation tactics  
4. Does not click link or reply  
5. Reports via official channel: forwards to phishing@clientorg.com with note "Suspected phishing \- look-alike domain"  
6. Deletes email after IT confirmation  
7. Notifies supervisor: "Received and reported phishing attempt"

**Why Compliant:** Systematic checklist application, detected look-alike domain, did not click despite urgency pressure, reported properly, did not forward to colleagues. Source Scenario 3 directly addresses look-alike domain pattern.

**Compliant Example 2 \- CEO Fraud Recognition:** Email appears to be from CEO: **From:** Display name shows "CEO Name" but actual address is ceo@clientname-secure.com (note: legitimate is clientname.com, this adds "-secure") **Subject:** URGENT: Wire Transfer Needed **Body:** "I'm in a meeting and need you to wire $50,000 to this vendor immediately for critical contract. I'll explain later. Here are wire details..."

Employee recognizes:

* CEO fraud pattern (authority \+ urgency)  
* Domain is not exact match (clientname-secure.com vs clientname.com)  
* Request outside normal workflow (direct wire request to non-finance employee)  
* "I'll explain later" avoids scrutiny

Employee response:

* Does NOT proceed with wire transfer  
* Calls CEO directly at known office number: "I received email requesting urgent wire transfer. Can you confirm?"  
* CEO: "I didn't send that. That's a scam. Report it."  
* Employee reports to IT security as CEO fraud attempt  
* Documents and notifies supervisor

**Why Compliant:** Recognized authority manipulation, verified domain, independently confirmed with CEO through trusted channel, did not comply with fraudulent request, reported properly.

**Non-Compliant Example:** Employee receives email from familiar colleague's address with unusual request: "Hey, I'm working from home and my system isn't working. Can you send me the patient database export file? I need it for urgent report. Attach to reply. Thanks\!"

Email actually from legitimate colleague's compromised account (attacker has access).

Employee thinks: "This is from my colleague Sarah, her email address is correct. She must really need help."

Employee attaches database export file (contains PHI) and replies with file.

**Why Non-Compliant:** Multiple failures:

* Did not verify unusual request through separate channel (should have called Sarah to confirm)  
* Request was outside normal workflow and vague ("urgent report")  
* Sent sensitive PHI file via email without verifying recipient's legitimate need and system security  
* Even legitimate colleague's account could be compromised (should verify through phone/in-person)  
* Creates incident: unauthorized PHI disclosure to compromised account  
* Result: Module 10 incident response required, potential breach depending on attacker actions, sanctions likely (failure to verify unusual request, inappropriate file sharing)

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Email Classification (20 Items, Timed 15 Minutes)**

Classify each email as: SAFE (legitimate), PHISHING (malicious), or SUSPICIOUS (uncertain, report for evaluation)

1. From: support@microsof1.com (1 instead of t) / Subject: Account verification / Urgent tone → PHISHING  
2. From: colleague@clientorg.com / Subject: Meeting notes attached / Expected meeting notes → SAFE (assuming verified context)  
3. From: noreply@paypal-secure.com / Subject: Your payment is pending / Link to update payment → PHISHING (paypal-secure.com is not legitimate paypal.com)  
4. From: IT@clientorg.com / Subject: Password expiration notice / Links to internal password reset portal → SUSPICIOUS (verify through official IT channel; legitimate IT doesn't usually request password change via email link)  
5. From: vendor@knownvendor.com / Subject: Invoice \#12345 / PDF attachment / No prior vendor relationship → SUSPICIOUS (unexpected vendor invoice)  
6. From: hr@clientorg.com / Subject: Benefits enrollment deadline / Links to known benefits portal → SAFE (if context appropriate and domain verified)  
7. From: ceo@clientorg.com (display name) but actual address is ceo@clientname-services.com / Urgent wire transfer request → PHISHING (domain mismatch, CEO fraud pattern)  
8. From: security@clientorg.com / "Your account has been compromised\! Click immediately\!" → PHISHING (urgency \+ fear tactics, even if domain looks right, verify independently)  
9. From: patient@gmail.com / Subject: Question about my bill / Legitimate patient inquiry → SAFE (if patient communication expected; verify identity per Module 4 before responding with PHI)  
10. From: colleague@clientorg.com / Subject: Check this out\! / Generic link with no context → SUSPICIOUS (unusual pattern even from known colleague; verify with colleague via phone before clicking)  
11. From: shipping@fedex-tracking.com / "Package delivery failed, click to reschedule" / Not expecting package → PHISHING (unsolicited, look-alike domain possibly)  
12. From: insurance@knownpayer.com / Subject: Claim update for patient \[name\] / Expected payer communication → SAFE (if domain verified and communication expected)  
13. From: helpdesk@clientorg.com / "Reply with your password to verify identity" → PHISHING (IT never requests passwords, even if domain appears legitimate)  
14. From: supervisor@clientorg.com / Subject: Performance review scheduled / Calendar invite → SAFE (if supervisor communication expected and domain verified)  
15. From: unknown@randomdomain.ru / Subject: You have won $1,000,000\! / Click here to claim → PHISHING (obvious)  
16. From: billing@hospital-billing-dept.com / Invoice for services / Your organization is hospital.com → PHISHING (look-alike domain with added words)  
17. From: noreply@linkedin.com / "Someone viewed your profile" / You have LinkedIn account → SUSPICIOUS (verify domain is legitimate linkedin.com; common phishing target)  
18. From: admin@clientorg.com / Subject: System maintenance tonight / Informational notice / No links or attachments → SAFE (informational only, domain legitimate)  
19. From: finance@clientorg.com / Subject: W2 form attached / Tax season appropriate timing / PDF from known HR system → SAFE (if expected and verified context)  
20. From: printer@clientorg.com / "Scanned document attached" / You didn't scan anything → SUSPICIOUS (could be legitimate misrouted scan or malware; verify before opening)

**Scoring:** 80% \= 16/20 correct classifications

**Scenario Exercise: Link Hover Practice**

For each scenario, describe what you see when hovering and what you do:

**Scenario 1:** Email text shows link as "Click here to reset password: https://microsoft.com" but hover reveals actual destination "https://micros0ft-login.ru" **Response:** Link destination does NOT match displayed text or legitimate domain. Phishing. Do not click. Report.

**Scenario 2:** Email from IT with text "Visit our new portal: https://clientorg.com/newportal" and hover shows "https://clientorg.com/newportal" **Response:** Link matches displayed text and legitimate domain. Still verify with IT through separate channel before clicking (could be spoofed email claiming to be IT). If verified legitimate, safe to click.

**Scenario 3:** Email with text "Update your insurance info here" but link is shortened URL "bit.ly/abc123" **Response:** Shortened URLs hide actual destination. Cannot verify legitimacy through hover. Do not click. Report as suspicious.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Caller claiming to be IT  
 **Learner plays:** Employee applying social engineering defense

**Trainer:** "Hi, this is Tom from IT helpdesk. We're doing system upgrades tonight and I need to verify your account credentials. What's your username and password?"

**Learner expected actions:**

1. Recognize red flag: IT requesting credentials over phone  
2. Refuse: "Our policy is that I don't provide my password to anyone, including IT. IT can reset my password if needed, but doesn't need my current password."  
3. If caller persists: "I need to verify this request. What's your employee ID and I'll call IT helpdesk back at the official number."  
4. End call professionally  
5. Call official IT helpdesk number: "Someone just called claiming to be IT requesting my password. Can you confirm if Tom from IT called me?"  
6. Report to IT security and supervisor as social engineering attempt

**Checklist: Phishing and Social Engineering Defense**

* \[ \] Inspects every email using 12-point checklist before clicking or opening

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Email classification drill (20 items): 4 points (16/20 \= 80%)  
* 12-point checklist application: 3 points  
* Link hover procedure: 2 points  
* Phone social engineering defense: 1 point  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (15 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** The 12-point email inspection checklist should be applied: A) Only to external emails  
 B) Only to emails from unknown senders  
 C) To every email before clicking links or opening attachments  
 D) Only when IT issues phishing alert

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Checklist applies to all emails; colleague accounts can be compromised.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — internal emails can be from compromised accounts.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Look-alike domain "micros0ft.com" (zero instead of O) is: A) Legitimate Microsoft domain  
 B) Phishing domain designed to deceive  
 C) Acceptable alternative domain  
 D) Typo by legitimate sender

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Character substitution creates look-alike domain for phishing (Source Scenario 3).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — this is intentional deception, not typo.

**Item 3 (True/False):** If an email creates sense of urgency ("Act now or lose access\!"), you should act quickly to avoid missing deadline.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Urgency is manipulation tactic; slow down and apply full checklist.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — falling for urgency pressure.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** When you receive suspicious email, you should: A) Forward to colleagues asking if they think it's safe  
 B) Click the link carefully to see where it goes  
 C) Report via official channel without clicking or forwarding  
 D) Delete immediately without telling anyone

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Official reporting without clicking/forwarding; forwarding spreads phishing.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — forwarding to colleagues spreads risk.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Email displays link text "microsoft.com" but hovering shows destination "malicious-site.ru". What do you do? A) Click since displayed text says microsoft.com  
 B) Do not click; link destination doesn't match, likely phishing  
 C) Click but watch for suspicious behavior  
 D) Ask colleague to click to verify

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Link destination mismatch is phishing indicator; hover reveals deception.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — displayed text can be different from actual destination.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Legitimate IT department will: A) Sometimes request your password over email for troubleshooting  
 B) Request your password over phone during emergencies  
 C) Never request your password; they can reset it without knowing current password  
 D) Only request password from trusted long-term employees

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** IT never needs user passwords; requesting password indicates social engineering.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — IT requests are common phishing pattern.

**Item 7 (True/False):** CEO fraud is phishing pattern where attacker impersonates executive to pressure urgent inappropriate action.

**Answer:** True  
 **Rationale:** CEO fraud exploits authority and urgency (source identifies as common pattern).

**Item 8 (MCQ):** Unexpected attachment with file type ".exe" should: A) Be opened to see what it contains  
 B) Not be opened; executable files are high-risk, report as suspicious  
 C) Be scanned by antivirus then opened  
 D) Be opened in safe mode

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Unexpected .exe attachments are high malware risk; do not open.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — even with antivirus, unexpected executables should be reported, not opened.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Caller claims to be your supervisor and urgently demands patient information. Caller ID shows unknown number. What do you do? A) Provide information since it's your supervisor  
 B) Hang up and call supervisor at known number to verify  
 C) Ask caller to prove identity through personal questions  
 D) Provide information but document afterward

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Verify claimed identity through independent trusted channel, never based on call alone.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — authority claim doesn't override verification requirement.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** "Too good to be true" offers in email are: A) Legitimate prizes from marketing campaigns  
 B) Manipulation tactic to trigger impulsive clicking  
 C) Safe if sender domain looks legitimate  
 D) Worth checking out if curious

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Extreme offers (too good or too bad) are manipulation tactics.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — curiosity is attacker's goal.

**Item 11 (True/False):** If email is from a colleague's legitimate address, it's safe to trust the content.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Colleague's account could be compromised; verify unusual requests through separate channel.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — assuming legitimate address \= legitimate content.

**Item 12 (MCQ):** Shortened URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl) in emails should be: A) Clicked to see where they go  
 B) Avoided; destination is hidden, increasing phishing risk  
 C) Safe if from known sender  
 D) Opened in incognito mode for safety

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Shortened URLs hide destination, preventing hover verification; increased risk.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — shortened URLs can be in compromised colleague's email.

**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** After you click link in phishing email and enter credentials on fake site, you realize the mistake. What do you do immediately? A) Do nothing and hope for the best  
 B) Change password immediately, report to IT and supervisor as compromise per Module 6  
 C) Just change password quietly  
 D) Wait to see if anything bad happens

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Immediate compromise response: password change, escalation, documentation per Module 6\.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — reporting required, not just password change.

**Item 14 (Short Answer):** What are the three elements you verify when hovering over a link?

**Answer:**

1. Actual destination URL/domain  
2. Whether destination matches displayed link text  
3. Whether destination domain matches legitimate expected organization

**Rationale:** Link hover reveals actual destination for verification.

**Item 15 (MCQ):** Phishing simulation exercises (tests sent by IT security) should be: A) Ignored since they're just tests  
 B) Reported via official channel just like real phishing  
 C) Clicked to show you can identify them  
 D) Forwarded to colleagues as examples

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Treat all suspicious emails the same; reporting simulations demonstrates proper behavior.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — clicking defeats purpose of security test.

#### **7\) QA and Audit Hooks**

**Evidence of Competence:**

* Email classification drill score (20 items, 16/20 \= 80%)

### **SAMPLE MODULE BUILD: COURSE 2, MODULE 3 (SPECIFICITY AND UNSPECIFIED CODES)**

**\[Following the framework above, here's one complete example:\]**

#### **MODULE 3: SPECIFICITY AND UNSPECIFIED CODES (75 MIN)**

**1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Unspecified ICD-10 codes (those ending in .9 or with "unspecified" descriptor) increase denial risk because payers need specific diagnosis details for medical necessity determination. Your role is NOT to select the more specific code yourself — you identify when documentation lacks specificity, draft neutral provider queries asking provider to clarify (without suggesting codes), and route to coder when specificity change required. Understanding specificity helps you prevent denials by catching gaps before claim submission.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Compares provider documentation to diagnosis code specificity  
* Identifies when "unspecified" code is used but documentation contains more specific details  
* Drafts neutral provider queries without suggesting codes  
* Routes to coder when specificity change required for documentation update

**2\) Definitions**

**Specificity:** Level of detail in ICD-10 code; more specific codes provide more clinical information (e.g., E11.42 "Type 2 diabetes with diabetic polyneuropathy" vs E11.9 "Type 2 diabetes without complications").

**Unspecified Code:** ICD-10 code indicating diagnosis category is documented but specific details are absent (often ends in .9 or contains "unspecified" in descriptor). Examples: E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes unspecified), M25.569 (Pain in unspecified knee).

**Specificity Mismatch:** Documentation contains specific details but code selected is unspecified (denial risk). Example: Provider documents "Type 2 diabetes with neuropathy" but code E11.9 (unspecified) is used instead of E11.4x (with neurological complications).

**Provider Query:** Neutral written communication to provider requesting clarification of documentation ambiguity or requesting additional clinical detail needed for accurate code assignment. Must NOT suggest specific codes (violates non-coder boundary).

**Denial Risk:** Increased probability of claim denial when specificity insufficient for payer's medical necessity review. Unspecified codes often trigger denials requiring additional documentation.

**Neutral Query Language:** Phrasing that requests information without leading provider toward particular answer or code. Example: "Please clarify location and laterality of knee pain" NOT "Could you specify left knee so we can use M25.562?"

**3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Identify Specificity Gaps**

1. Review diagnosis code assigned in system (claim, authorization request, order)  
2. Check code descriptor: Does it contain "unspecified" or end in .9?  
3. If yes (unspecified code present): Review provider documentation in record  
4. Look for specific details in documentation that could support more specific code:  
   * Laterality (left, right, bilateral)  
   * Complication or manifestation  
   * Severity (mild, moderate, severe)  
   * Acuity (acute, chronic, acute on chronic)  
   * Anatomical detail  
5. Compare documentation detail to code specificity:  
   * Documentation contains specifics but code is unspecified? → Specificity gap identified  
   * Documentation truly lacks specifics and code reflects documentation? → No action (code matches documentation)  
6. If specificity gap identified: document gap and route to coder or draft provider query (per client workflow — needs\_review)

**Procedure: Draft Neutral Provider Query**

1. Identify what clinical information is needed for more specific code (DO NOT identify which code — that's coder's role)  
2. Reference documentation location: "In the \[date\] office note, you documented..."  
3. Ask open-ended question requesting specific detail:  
   * "Could you please clarify the specific type of complication related to the diabetes?"  
   * "Please specify the laterality (left, right, or bilateral) of the knee pain."  
   * "Could you document the severity of the condition?"  
4. DO NOT suggest codes: "Please specify so we can use code E11.4x" is violation of non-coder boundary  
5. DO NOT provide multiple choice if possible: "Is it left or right knee?" is acceptable; listing code options is not  
6. Submit query through approved workflow (typically coder reviews and sends, or provider query portal)

**Procedure: Route Specificity Issues to Coder**

1. If documentation contains specific details but unspecified code is assigned: flag for coder review  
2. Document in ticket/note: "Code \[X\] is unspecified. Documentation in \[location\] indicates \[specific detail present\]. Routed to coder for review."  
3. If documentation lacks specifics: flag for provider query process  
4. DO NOT change code yourself  
5. DO NOT assign code based on your reading of documentation  
6. Wait for coder or provider response before proceeding with claim/authorization

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if you're tempted to "just pick the more specific code" — exceeds non-coder boundary  
* Stop if uncertain whether documentation supports more specific code — route to coder for determination  
* Stop if you're drafting query that suggests specific codes — rewrite to neutral open-ended question

**Escalation Path:** Coder → Coding supervisor → Provider (for clinical clarification)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Specificity gaps documented with code, documentation location, specific detail present or missing  
* Provider queries documented with query text, submission date, response received date

**4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 (Source Scenario 1):** **Situation:** Claim has code E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications). Review of provider note shows: "Patient has Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy affecting lower extremities."

**Action:** Non-coder identifies mismatch: Documentation specifies neurological complication (neuropathy) but code E11.9 is unspecified (no complications). Documents finding: "Code E11.9 used but provider note \[date\] documents neuropathy. Specificity gap identified. Routing to coder for review."

Routes to coder. Coder reviews, determines E11.42 (Type 2 diabetes with diabetic polyneuropathy) is supported by documentation, changes code, resubmits claim.

**Why Compliant:** Non-coder identified gap, documented clearly, routed to coder for code selection. Did NOT suggest specific code. Stayed within non-coder boundary.

**Compliant Example 2:** **Situation:** Authorization request uses M25.569 (Pain in unspecified knee). Documentation states "right knee pain."

**Action:** Non-coder drafts provider query (if workflow requires non-coder to initiate queries; otherwise routes to coder): "In the \[date\] note, you documented knee pain. Could you please specify which knee (right, left, or bilateral) is affected? This will help ensure accurate authorization processing."

Query submitted. Provider responds: "Right knee." Coder updates code to M25.561 (Pain in right knee).

**Why Compliant:** Neutral query without suggesting codes, requested specific clinical detail (laterality), maintained non-coder boundary.

**Non-Compliant Example:** **Situation:** Authorization denied due to unspecified diagnosis code. Non-coder reads provider note, sees mention of "left knee," and changes code from M25.569 to M25.562 in system without coder review.

**Why Non-Compliant:** Non-coder assigned code based on documentation review. Violates non-coder boundary (Module 10 boundary violations trigger remediation). Even though code selection appears correct, non-coder is not authorized to make coding decisions. Correct action: route to coder for code assignment.

**Result:** Boundary violation documented, Module 2 refresher required, supervisor coaching, potential sanctions if pattern continues.

**5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Documentation-to-Code Matching (10 Pairs)**

For each, identify if specificity matches documentation or gap exists:

1. Documentation: "Type 2 diabetes" / Code: E11.9 → MATCH (unspecified in documentation and code)  
2. Documentation: "Type 2 diabetes with retinopathy" / Code: E11.9 → GAP (documentation has complication, code is unspecified)  
3. Documentation: "Left knee pain" / Code: M25.569 (unspecified knee) → GAP (laterality documented but code unspecified)  
4. Documentation: "Hypertension" / Code: I10 (Essential hypertension) → MATCH (I10 has no specificity levels; matches documentation)  
5. Documentation: "Acute bronchitis" / Code: J20.9 (Acute bronchitis, unspecified) → MATCH (if organism not documented, unspecified is correct)  
6. Documentation: "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation" / Code: J44.1 → MATCH (J44.1 is COPD with acute exacerbation, specific code matches specific documentation)  
7. Documentation: "Shoulder pain" / Code: M25.519 (Pain in unspecified shoulder) → MATCH (laterality not documented, unspecified appropriate)  
8. Documentation: "Right shoulder pain" / Code: M25.519 → GAP (laterality documented but code unspecified)  
9. Documentation: "Diabetes mellitus" (no type specified) / Code: E11.9 → UNCERTAIN/QUERY NEEDED (type not documented; need provider clarification whether Type 1 or Type 2\)  
10. Documentation: "Fracture of left femur shaft, initial encounter" / Code: S72.302A → MATCH (specific laterality, location, encounter type in code matches documentation)

**Scoring:** 80% \= 8/10 correct identifications

**Scenario Exercise: Draft Neutral Provider Query**

**Scenario:** Provider documented "diabetes with kidney disease" but current code is E11.9 (unspecified). Draft neutral provider query.

**Answer:** "Dr. \[Name\], in your \[date\] office note, you documented diabetes with kidney disease. To ensure accurate coding and reduce denial risk, could you please clarify the specific type of diabetic kidney complication? For example, is this diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease due to diabetes, or another specific condition? This additional detail will help us assign the most accurate code. Thank you."

**Why Correct:** References specific documentation, asks open-ended question for clarification, does NOT suggest codes, maintains professional tone, explains benefit to provider (denial prevention).

**Checklist: Specificity Gap Management**

* \[ \] Reviewed code descriptor for "unspecified" or .9 ending  
* \[ \] Reviewed provider documentation for specific details  
* \[ \] Compared documentation specificity to code specificity  
* \[ \] If gap identified: documented location of specific details in documentation  
* \[ \] If gap identified: routed to coder OR drafted neutral provider query (per workflow)  
* \[ \] Did NOT suggest specific codes in query  
* \[ \] Did NOT change code independently  
* \[ \] Maintained non-coder boundary

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Matching drill (10 pairs): 4 points (8/10 \= 80%)  
* Neutral query drafting: 3 points (neutral language, no code suggestions, clear question)  
* Gap identification procedure: 2 points  
* Non-coder boundary adherence: 1 point  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

**6\) Knowledge Check (15 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Unspecified codes typically: A) Are always incorrect  
 B) Indicate diagnosis documented but specific details absent  
 C) Should never be used  
 D) Are preferred by payers

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Unspecified codes reflect documentation; sometimes appropriate if details truly absent.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — unspecified codes are sometimes appropriate when documentation lacks specifics.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** If documentation says "Type 2 diabetes with neuropathy" but code is E11.9 (unspecified), you should: A) Change code to E11.4x yourself  
 B) Identify specificity gap and route to coder  
 C) Ignore since diabetes code is present  
 D) Query provider even though documentation is specific

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Identify gap, route to coder for code assignment (non-coder boundary).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — non-coders do not assign codes.

**Item 3 (True/False):** Provider queries should suggest specific code options to help provider choose correct one.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Queries must be neutral; suggesting codes violates non-coder boundary and can influence clinical documentation.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — appearing "helpful" by suggesting codes crosses boundary.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Specificity gap means: A) Code is wrong  
 B) Documentation contains specific details but code is unspecified  
 C) Documentation is incomplete  
 D) Coder made error

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Gap \= documentation more specific than code reflects.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — gap doesn't necessarily mean error; may be oversight or workflow issue.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Authorization request denied due to "unspecified diagnosis code E11.9." Provider note says "Type 2 diabetes." What do you do? A) Change code to more specific diabetes code  
 B) Code E11.9 matches documentation (no complication documented); resubmit with additional documentation if available, or query provider for complications  
 C) Always use E11.65 for diabetes  
 D) Ignore denial

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** If documentation truly is "Type 2 diabetes" without further details, E11.9 is appropriate match. Consider whether provider query needed for complications, or if additional documentation exists elsewhere.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — cannot change code without documentation support or coder review.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Neutral provider query language means: A) Using medical terminology  
 B) Asking open-ended questions without suggesting codes or answers  
 C) Being polite  
 D) Keeping queries short

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Neutral \= open-ended, doesn't lead provider to specific answer or code.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — politeness is important but not the definition of "neutral."

**Item 7 (True/False):** If you read provider note and see specific details that support more specific code, you can change the code since you're helping improve specificity.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Non-coders never assign or change codes; route to coder regardless of how obvious the answer seems.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — "helping" crosses non-coder boundary.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** Unspecified codes increase denial risk because: A) They

are always wrong  
 B) Payers need specific diagnosis details for medical necessity determination  
 C) They cost more  
 D) They are outdated

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Payers require specificity to evaluate medical necessity; unspecified codes lack needed detail.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Code M25.569 (Pain in unspecified knee) is used but documentation says "bilateral knee pain." What action? A) No action needed, code is fine  
 B) Identify gap (bilateral documented but code unspecified), route to coder  
 C) Change to bilateral knee pain code yourself  
 D) Query provider even though bilateral is documented

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Documentation supports more specific code; route to coder for code assignment.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Your role in specificity management is to: A) Select the most specific code available  
 B) Flag gaps between documentation and code specificity, route to coder  
 C) Teach providers how to document better  
 D) Override coder decisions when wrong

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Non-coder role: identify and flag, route to coder for decisions.

## **COURSE 2: ICD-10 CODING OVERVIEW FOR OPERATIONS TEAMS**

### **MODULE 7: MEDICAL NECESSITY AND DIAGNOSIS SELECTION (90 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Medical necessity (diagnosis justifies service clinically) is distinct from coverage (payer policy allows payment). Your role is recognizing when diagnosis-service mismatches create denial risk, NOT determining whether service is medically necessary (that's provider/coder role). LCD (Local Coverage Determination) and NCD (National Coverage Determination) are payer policies specifying which diagnoses support coverage for specific services — these require payer-policy confirmation (needs\_review per client). Understanding this distinction prevents promising patients "insurance will cover it" when you cannot make that determination.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Compares diagnosis context to requested service context  
* Identifies potential denial risk when diagnosis doesn't obviously support service  
* Routes to authorization/coding team when denial risk suspected  
* Never promises coverage or approval to patients  
* Distinguishes between "clinically appropriate" (medical necessity) and "payer will pay" (coverage)

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Medical Necessity:** Clinical standard requiring service to be appropriate for diagnosis, consistent with standards of care, not experimental, and expected to improve patient condition. Determined by provider based on clinical judgment.

**Coverage:** Payer policy determination of whether service will be paid based on contract terms, LCD/NCD requirements, and diagnosis code submitted. Determined by payer, not provider or operational staff.

**Medical Necessity vs Coverage Distinction (Critical):** Service can be medically necessary (clinically appropriate) but not covered (payer won't pay). Example: Provider determines imaging is medically necessary for patient's condition, but payer's LCD doesn't include that diagnosis as covered indication for that imaging type. Service is medically necessary but may not be covered.

**LCD (Local Coverage Determination):** Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) policy specifying coverage criteria for specific services in specific geographic regions. Includes covered diagnosis codes, frequency limits, documentation requirements. (needs\_review for client-specific LCD access and application)

**NCD (National Coverage Determination):** Medicare national policy covering all regions. Takes precedence over LCDs. Specifies coverage criteria for specific services nationwide. (needs\_review for client-specific NCD access and application)

**Prior Authorization:** Payer's advance approval required before service delivery to confirm coverage. Often triggered by diagnosis-service combination requiring medical necessity review.

**Denial Risk Indicators:** Diagnosis-service combinations likely to result in claim denial (unspecified diagnosis for high-tech service, diagnosis doesn't match body system of procedure, frequency exceeds typical coverage limits, experimental service codes).

**Coverage Policy Resources (needs\_review):** Client-specific tools for accessing LCD/NCD and payer policies. May include payer portals, coverage databases, or internal policy libraries. Exact resources and access procedures need\_review per client.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Identify Potential Denial Risk in Diagnosis-Service Pairing**

1. **Review service requested:**

   * What procedure/service is ordered? (CPT code if available, or service description)  
   * What is clinical purpose stated by provider?  
2. **Review diagnosis code(s) associated with service:**

   * What diagnosis code(s) are listed as reason for service?  
   * Does diagnosis relate to body system of service? (Example: knee pain diagnosis for knee MRI \= related; diabetes diagnosis for knee MRI \= questionable relationship)  
3. **Apply common-sense pairing assessment:**

   * Does diagnosis logically support need for this service?  
   * Example matches: Chest pain → cardiac testing; Back pain → spine imaging; Diabetes → A1C lab  
   * Example mismatches: Hypertension → knee MRI; Ankle sprain → brain CT  
4. **Check for high-risk indicators:**

   * Unspecified diagnosis (ends in .9) for high-cost or high-tech service  
   * Diagnosis doesn't match anatomical area of service  
   * Frequency of service seems excessive for diagnosis  
   * Service description includes "experimental" or "investigational"  
5. **If potential denial risk identified:**

   * Document concern: "Service \[X\] requested with diagnosis \[Y\]. Potential coverage risk due to \[mismatch/unspecified code/frequency\]. Routing to authorization team for policy review."  
   * Route to authorization coordinator or coding team per workflow (needs\_review)  
   * DO NOT tell patient service is "not covered" — you are flagging for expert review, not making coverage determination  
6. **If confident pairing is appropriate:**

   * Proceed with normal workflow  
   * Still avoid promising coverage ("This should be covered" is not appropriate; "I've submitted for authorization review" is appropriate)

**Procedure: Access and Interpret Coverage Policies (needs\_review per client tools)**

**Note:** Exact procedures depend on client's policy access tools and workflow. General framework:

1. **Identify payer and service:**

   * What insurance does patient have?  
   * What specific service needs coverage verification?  
2. **Access coverage policy tool:**

   * Client may provide: payer portals, LCD/NCD databases, internal policy library, authorization software with embedded coverage rules  
   * Navigate to relevant service category (imaging, labs, DME, procedures)  
3. **Locate coverage criteria:**

   * Search by CPT code or service description  
   * Identify covered diagnosis codes listed in policy  
   * Note frequency/quantity limits if specified  
   * Note documentation requirements if specified  
4. **Compare patient's diagnosis to covered diagnosis list:**

   * Is patient's diagnosis code on covered list? → Likely covered (still requires verification)  
   * Is patient's diagnosis code absent from list? → Potential denial risk, escalate for policy interpretation  
   * Is policy ambiguous or unclear? → Escalate, do not guess  
5. **Document findings:**

   * "Per \[payer\] LCD, diagnosis \[X\] is listed as covered indication for service \[Y\]. Proceeding with authorization request."  
   * "Per \[payer\] LCD, diagnosis \[X\] is not listed as covered indication for service \[Y\]. Escalating to authorization team for policy review and possible provider query."  
6. **Safe stops:**

   * If cannot access policy: escalate to supervisor for access assistance  
   * If policy is unclear or contradictory: escalate to authorization specialist, do not interpret independently  
   * If policy seems to conflict with medical necessity: escalate (provider/authorization team resolves, not operational staff)

**Procedure: Communicate Coverage Uncertainty to Patients (Safe Language)**

**Never say:**

* "Your insurance will cover this" (you cannot guarantee)  
* "This is not covered" (you cannot definitively determine)  
* "The doctor ordered it so it's covered" (medical necessity ≠ automatic coverage)  
* "It's medically necessary so insurance has to pay" (conflates medical necessity with coverage)

**Do say:**

* "I've submitted this for authorization review. The payer will determine coverage based on your policy."  
* "I've identified a potential coverage question and escalated to our authorization team to review the policy."  
* "Coverage depends on your specific insurance policy. I recommend calling your insurance to verify coverage for this service."  
* "Authorization is pending. We'll notify you once we receive the payer's decision."

**If patient asks directly "Will my insurance cover this?":** "Coverage depends on your specific policy and the payer's determination. I've submitted for authorization \[or: this is being reviewed for authorization\]. You can also call your insurance using the number on your card to verify coverage for \[service\]. We'll let you know what the payer decides."

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if diagnosis-service pairing seems questionable — escalate for policy review before proceeding  
* Stop if patient asks for coverage guarantee — use safe language, never promise coverage  
* Stop if policy interpretation is unclear — escalate to authorization specialist  
* Stop if tempted to say "medically necessary means covered" — these are separate determinations

**Escalation Path:** Authorization coordinator → Coding supervisor (for diagnosis questions) → Payer representative (for policy clarification)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Denial risk flags documented with specific concern (diagnosis mismatch, unspecified code, frequency issue)  
* Policy review requests documented with service, diagnosis, payer, policy question  
* Patient communications documented using safe language (no coverage promises)

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- Denial Risk Prediction:** Order: MRI of lumbar spine  
 Diagnosis: M54.5 (Low back pain)  
 Payer: Medicare

Employee review:

* Service (spine MRI) matches diagnosis body system (back pain) ✓  
* Diagnosis is commonly covered indication for lumbar MRI per general knowledge  
* Diagnosis is specific (not unspecified .9 code) ✓  
* No obvious red flags

Employee action: Proceeds with authorization request submission. Documents: "Authorization request submitted for lumbar spine MRI with diagnosis M54.5. Diagnosis appropriate for service." Does NOT tell patient "This will be covered" but says "I've submitted for authorization. You'll be notified of the decision."

**Why Compliant:** Appropriate pairing assessment, proceeded appropriately, used safe language with patient, avoided coverage guarantee.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Denial Risk Escalation:** Order: MRI brain  
 Diagnosis: E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)  
 Payer: Commercial insurance

Employee review:

* Service (brain MRI) does NOT match diagnosis body system (diabetes) ✗  
* Diagnosis doesn't obviously support need for brain imaging  
* Potential diagnosis mismatch or documentation gap

Employee action: Documents concern: "Brain MRI requested with diagnosis E11.9 (diabetes). Diagnosis doesn't appear to support neurological imaging. Possible documentation gap or diagnosis mismatch. Routing to authorization team for policy review. May require provider query to clarify clinical indication." Routes to authorization coordinator.

Authorization coordinator reviews provider order notes, discovers patient has diabetic neuropathy affecting vision (documented elsewhere but not captured in diagnosis code). Coordinates with coder to add appropriate neurological complication code. Authorization proceeds with corrected diagnosis.

**Why Compliant:** Identified mismatch, escalated appropriately, did not independently determine "not covered," allowed authorization specialists to investigate and resolve.

**Non-Compliant Example (Source Scenario 19 Context):** Patient calls: "Will my insurance cover the CT scan Dr. Smith ordered?"

Employee: "Yes, the doctor ordered it so it's medically necessary. Your insurance has to cover it."

Patient receives CT scan. Claim denies because diagnosis code doesn't meet payer's coverage criteria per LCD. Patient receives bill for $2,500. Patient complains: "Your staff told me it would be covered\!"

**Why Non-Compliant:**

* Promised coverage without verification (cannot guarantee)  
* Conflated medical necessity (provider's determination) with coverage (payer's determination)  
* Source Scenario 19 addresses coverage limitation vs coding error distinction  
* Created patient expectation that wasn't met  
* Organizational liability for misinformation

**Correct response should have been:** "Coverage depends on your insurance policy. I've submitted for authorization. You can also call your insurance to verify coverage. We'll notify you once we receive the payer's decision."

**Result:** Patient complaint, supervisor coaching on safe language, documentation of communication failure, possible financial adjustment to patient account depending on organizational policy, refresher training on medical necessity vs coverage distinction.

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Denial Risk Prediction (12 Scenarios)**

For each diagnosis-service pair, classify as: LOW RISK (appropriate pairing), MODERATE RISK (uncertain, needs review), HIGH RISK (likely denial)

1. Diagnosis: M25.561 (Pain in right knee) / Service: MRI right knee → LOW RISK (diagnosis matches service)  
2. Diagnosis: E11.9 (Diabetes unspecified) / Service: Cardiac catheterization → MODERATE/HIGH RISK (diagnosis doesn't match service; possible documentation gap)  
3. Diagnosis: I10 (Essential hypertension) / Service: Blood pressure monitoring → LOW RISK (diagnosis matches service)  
4. Diagnosis: Z23 (Encounter for immunization) / Service: Flu vaccine → LOW RISK (appropriate)  
5. Diagnosis: R07.9 (Chest pain, unspecified) / Service: Cardiac stress test → MODERATE RISK (unspecified diagnosis for significant service; may need more specific diagnosis)  
6. Diagnosis: J44.1 (COPD with acute exacerbation) / Service: Chest X-ray → LOW RISK (diagnosis supports imaging)  
7. Diagnosis: G43.909 (Migraine, unspecified) / Service: Brain MRI → MODERATE RISK (unspecified diagnosis; MRI often requires specific indication)  
8. Diagnosis: Z00.00 (Encounter for general adult medical examination without abnormal findings) / Service: Colonoscopy → MODERATE RISK (screening vs diagnostic distinction matters for coverage)  
9. Diagnosis: M79.3 (Panniculitis, unspecified) / Service: Knee replacement → HIGH RISK (diagnosis doesn't support major surgery indication)  
10. Diagnosis: E11.65 (Type 2 diabetes with hyperglycemia) / Service: Glucose monitoring supplies → LOW RISK (diagnosis supports service)  
11. Diagnosis: S82.001A (Unspecified fracture of right patella, initial encounter) / Service: Knee X-ray → LOW RISK (diagnosis supports imaging)  
12. Diagnosis: F41.9 (Anxiety disorder, unspecified) / Service: Cardiac catheterization → HIGH RISK (psychiatric diagnosis doesn't support cardiac procedure; likely documentation error or wrong diagnosis submitted)

**Scoring:** 80% \= 10/12 correct risk classifications

**Scenario Exercise: Patient Communication with Safe Language**

**Scenario:** Patient calls: "I had an MRI last week. My doctor says I need surgery. Will my insurance cover the surgery?"

**Your response (write what you would say):**

**Sample Compliant Response:** "Surgery authorization depends on your specific insurance policy and their review of the medical necessity. Dr. \[Name\]'s office will submit an authorization request with the diagnosis and procedure details. The insurance company will review and make a coverage determination. I recommend calling your insurance using the number on your card to ask about coverage for the specific surgery code, and you can ask about your deductible and co-insurance as well. We'll notify you once we receive the authorization decision from your insurance."

**Why Compliant:**

* No coverage guarantee given  
* Explains authorization process  
* Directs patient to their insurance for coverage questions  
* Distinguishes between submission and approval  
* Acknowledges patient will be notified of decision

**Non-Compliant Response:** "Yes, if the doctor says you need it, insurance will cover it."

**Why Non-Compliant:**

* False coverage guarantee  
* Conflates medical necessity with coverage  
* Creates expectation that may not be met

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Patient asking coverage questions  
 **Learner plays:** Employee using safe language

**Round 1:** **Trainer:** "My doctor ordered blood work. Is that covered?"

**Learner expected response:** "Coverage depends on your insurance policy. I've submitted the order. You can call your insurance to verify coverage for lab work with the diagnosis your doctor documented. We'll bill your insurance and notify you of any patient responsibility."

**Round 2:** **Trainer:** "But the doctor said I need it. That means it's covered, right?"

**Learner expected response:** "The doctor has determined the lab work is medically necessary for your care. Coverage is a separate determination made by your insurance company based on your policy. They'll review the order and let us know what's covered under your plan."

**Round 3:** **Trainer:** "This is so confusing. Will I have to pay for it or not?"

**Learner expected response:** "I understand this is frustrating. Your final cost depends on your insurance coverage, deductible, and co-insurance. I recommend calling your insurance at \[number on card\] to get a specific estimate for this service. You can also ask our billing office about our financial assistance programs or payment plans if you have concerns about cost. We'll do our best to work with your insurance and let you know the outcome."

**Checklist: Medical Necessity and Coverage Distinction**

* \[ \] Understands medical necessity (clinical appropriateness) ≠ coverage (payer payment)  
* \[ \] Identifies potential denial risks in diagnosis-service pairings  
* \[ \] Escalates coverage questions to authorization team  
* \[ \] Never promises coverage to patients  
* \[ \] Uses safe language ("submitted for authorization," "depends on your policy")  
* \[ \] Distinguishes between submission and approval  
* \[ \] Accesses coverage policies correctly (if applicable to role)  
* \[ \] Documents denial risk flags appropriately

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Denial risk prediction (12 scenarios): 4 points (10/12 \= 83%)  
* Patient communication safe language: 3 points  
* Medical necessity vs coverage distinction: 2 points  
* Escalation judgment: 1 point  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (20 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Medical necessity means: A) Insurance will pay for the service  
 B) Service is clinically appropriate for the diagnosis  
 C) Patient wants the service  
 D) Doctor ordered the service

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Medical necessity \= clinical appropriateness; separate from coverage determination.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — medical necessity ≠ coverage guarantee.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Coverage means: A) Doctor says service is needed  
 B) Service is medically necessary  
 C) Payer will pay based on policy terms  
 D) Service is clinically appropriate

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Coverage \= payer determination of payment based on policy.

**Item 3 (True/False):** If a service is medically necessary, insurance must cover it.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Service can be medically necessary but not covered by policy (source failure mode: confusing medical necessity vs coverage).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — this is the critical misconception the module addresses.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** LCD stands for: A) Local Coverage Decision  
 B) Local Coverage Determination  
 C) Limited Coverage Database  
 D) Licensed Coverage Document

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Local Coverage Determination is the correct term.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Patient asks "Will my insurance cover this MRI?" You should respond: A) "Yes, the doctor ordered it."  
 B) "Coverage depends on your policy. I've submitted for authorization."  
 C) "It's medically necessary so insurance has to pay."  
 D) "I guarantee it will be covered."

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Safe language avoids coverage guarantee while explaining process.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A or C — conflating medical necessity with coverage.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Diagnosis-service pairing shows: Brain MRI with diagnosis "Diabetes." This is: A) Appropriate pairing  
 B) Potential denial risk; diagnosis doesn't match service body system  
 C) Automatically denied  
 D) No concern

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Diabetes diagnosis doesn't obviously support brain imaging; potential documentation gap or mismatch requiring investigation.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — not recognizing mismatch.

**Item 7 (True/False):** Your role in medical necessity determination is to decide whether the service is clinically appropriate for the diagnosis.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Medical necessity determination is provider's clinical role; operational staff flag potential coverage issues, not make medical necessity judgments.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** When you identify potential denial risk in diagnosis-service pairing, you should: A) Deny the service  
 B) Call the patient and tell them it won't be covered  
 C) Escalate to authorization team for policy review  
 D) Change the diagnosis code to match the service

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Flag for expert review; don't independently determine denial or change codes.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — changing diagnosis codes exceeds non-coder boundary.

**Item 9 (MCQ):** Unspecified diagnosis codes (ending in .9) for high-cost services create: A) No concern  
 B) Increased denial risk due to lack of specificity  
 C) Automatic approval  
 D) Faster processing

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Unspecified codes lack detail payers need for medical necessity review.

**Item 10 (Scenario MCQ):** Claim denied because "diagnosis does not support medical necessity per LCD." This means: A) Doctor made medical error  
 B) Coder assigned wrong code  
 C) Payer's coverage policy doesn't list this diagnosis as covered indication for this service  
 D) Service was not medically necessary

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** LCD coverage criteria not met; separate from whether service was clinically appropriate (Source Scenario 19 addresses this distinction).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — denial doesn't necessarily mean service wasn't medically necessary.

**Item 11 (MCQ):** Prior authorization is: A) Automatic approval for all services  
 B) Payer's advance review to confirm coverage before service delivery  
 C) Provider's permission to perform service  
 D) Patient's agreement to treatment

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Prior auth \= payer's advance coverage determination.

**Item 12 (True/False):** If a provider determines a service is medically necessary, the insurance company must accept that determination and pay the claim.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Payers make independent coverage determinations based on policy; provider's medical necessity judgment doesn't obligate payment.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — not understanding payer independence in coverage decisions.

**Item 13 (MCQ):** When patient asks about coverage, safe language includes: A) "It's covered, the doctor ordered it."  
 B) "I've submitted for authorization. Coverage depends on your policy."  
 C) "Don't worry, insurance always covers this."  
 D) "Definitely covered."

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Safe language avoids guarantees, explains process, acknowledges policy dependence.

**Item 14 (Scenario MCQ):** Order for physical therapy with diagnosis "Diabetes." What do you do? A) Proceed normally, diagnosis is fine  
 B) Flag potential mismatch (diabetes doesn't obviously support PT need), escalate for review  
 C) Deny the order  
 D) Change diagnosis to musculoskeletal code

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Diagnosis-service mismatch requires investigation; possible documentation gap.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — not recognizing body system mismatch.

**Item 15 (MCQ):** NCD stands for: A) New Coverage Directive  
 B) National Coverage Determination  
 C) Necessary Coverage Document  
 D) Non-Covered Diagnosis

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** National Coverage Determination is correct term for Medicare national policies.

**Item 16 (True/False):** You can guarantee coverage if the diagnosis code appears on the payer's covered diagnosis list for that service.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Even with covered diagnosis, other factors affect coverage (frequency limits, documentation requirements, patient's specific policy terms); cannot guarantee.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — oversimplifying coverage determination.

**Item 17 (MCQ):** If payer LCD is unclear about whether diagnosis supports service, you should: A) Interpret it yourself using best judgment  
 B) Escalate to authorization specialist for policy interpretation  
 C) Assume it's covered  
 D) Deny the service

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Policy interpretation requires expertise; escalate ambiguous cases.

**Item 18 (Scenario MCQ):** Patient: "My doctor says this test is medically necessary." You respond: A) "Then insurance will cover it."  
 B) "Medical necessity and coverage are separate. I've submitted for authorization; the payer will review based on your policy."  
 C) "Doctors don't determine coverage."  
 D) "You'll definitely have to pay."

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Educates on distinction while remaining helpful and professional.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — conflating medical necessity with coverage.

**Item 19 (Short Answer):** Explain the difference between medical necessity and coverage in one sentence each.

**Answer:**  
 Medical necessity: Service is clinically appropriate for the diagnosis based on standards of care (provider determination).  
 Coverage: Payer will pay for the service based on policy terms and coverage criteria (payer determination).

**Item 20 (MCQ):** Source Scenario 19 teaches that denial due to "diagnosis not covered per LCD" means: A) Coding error occurred  
 B) Service wasn't medically necessary  
 C) Coverage policy doesn't support this diagnosis-service combination  
 D) All of the above

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** LCD denial reflects payer's coverage policy, not necessarily coding error or lack of medical necessity.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — assuming denial always means coding error rather than coverage limitation.

## **COURSE 3: DAY-TO-DAY DOCUMENT HYGIENE AND DATA HANDLING**

### **MODULE 5: SCREENSHOT PROHIBITION AND ALTERNATIVES (45 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Screenshots of PHI screens are absolutely prohibited regardless of purpose, urgency, or recipient. Screenshots create uncontrolled PHI copies that persist on devices, can be accidentally shared, and are difficult to secure or delete permanently. This module trains alternative methods for troubleshooting, training, and communication that don't require screenshots: verbal descriptions, test environment demonstrations, approved screen sharing with proper controls, ticketing system descriptions, and sanitized template captures from non-PHI screens.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Never takes screenshots of PHI screens under any circumstance  
* Uses verbal description or approved screen sharing for troubleshooting  
* Uses test environment or training environment for demonstrations  
* Escalates if supervisor or colleague requests screenshot  
* Reports if screenshot was taken accidentally (immediate deletion \+ incident report)

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Screenshot:** Digital image capture of screen content using built-in tools (Snipping Tool, Print Screen, screenshot apps) or phone camera. Creates permanent image file.

**PHI Screen:** Any display showing patient identifiers (name, MRN, account number, DOB, etc.) combined with health or payment context. Includes EHR screens, billing systems, claims platforms, authorization portals, patient portals, scheduling systems when patient data is visible.

**Screenshot Prohibition:** Absolute policy forbidding screenshots of PHI screens regardless of: purpose (training, troubleshooting, documentation), recipient (supervisor, colleague, IT), device (work computer, personal phone), or urgency. No exceptions.

**Phone Camera Capture:** Taking photo of computer screen using phone camera; included in screenshot prohibition (same PHI control failure).

**Approved Screen Sharing:** Real-time display of screen via approved collaboration tools (Teams, Zoom) with proper session controls (password protection, participant verification, recording disabled or controlled). Distinct from screenshot because temporary display, not permanent file creation.

**Test Environment / Training Environment:** Non-production system with fake patient data or no patient data, used for training and testing without PHI exposure. Screenshots may be allowed in test environment per policy (needs\_review).

**Verbal Description:** Explaining screen content or navigation issue without visual capture. Example: "On the Claims Search screen, I enter account number in the top field, click Search, but the results grid shows 'no records found' even though I know this account exists."

**Sanitized Template:** Screenshot of blank screen template from test environment or documentation, with no actual patient data visible. May be used for training if approved and verified PHI-free.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Troubleshoot System Issues Without Screenshots**

**Scenario: System not working as expected, need help from IT or colleague**

1. **Describe the issue verbally or in writing:**

   * What screen/module are you in? (name of screen, not screenshot)  
   * What action are you attempting? (button clicked, field entered)  
   * What happens? (error message text, unexpected behavior)  
   * What do you expect to happen?  
2. **Example description for IT ticket:** "I'm in the Authorization Request module. I enter account number in the 'Account Number' field, select service type 'MRI' from dropdown, enter requested date, and click 'Submit.' The system displays error message: 'Invalid service type for this account.' I expected the request to submit successfully. This worked yesterday for similar accounts."

3. **If verbal/written description insufficient:**

   * Use approved screen sharing tool (needs\_review per client):  
     * Schedule Teams/Zoom call with IT or colleague  
     * Share screen in real-time (not screenshot)  
     * Demonstrate issue live while other party watches  
     * Verify session is password-protected and participants are authorized  
   * OR: Request IT remote access session where IT views your screen directly via support software  
4. **NEVER:**

   * Take screenshot and attach to email  
   * Take screenshot and attach to ticket  
   * Take phone photo of screen  
   * Share screenshot via any messaging platform  
5. **If colleague or supervisor requests screenshot:**

   * Refuse professionally: "Our policy prohibits screenshots of PHI screens. I can describe the issue verbally, schedule a screen share session, or you can view my screen directly."  
   * If pressure continues: escalate to compliance (safe stop Rule 4\)

**Procedure: Provide Training or Demonstrate Process Without Screenshots**

**Scenario: Need to train colleague on how to use system feature**

1. **Use test environment for demonstration:**

   * Access client's training or test environment (if available)  
   * Perform demonstration with fake/test patient data  
   * Trainee follows along in their test environment  
   * If screenshot needed for training materials: take screenshot from test environment only, verify no real PHI present  
2. **If test environment unavailable, use approved alternatives:**

   * **Live demonstration with screen sharing:** Schedule session, share screen via approved tool, trainee watches and takes notes  
   * **Verbal walkthrough with written steps:** Create step-by-step written instructions ("Click \[button name\], enter \[field description\], select \[option\]")  
   * **Use existing training documentation:** Reference official training guides, videos, or documentation from vendor or client training library  
3. **For training materials creation:**

   * Use test environment screenshots only (verify PHI-free)  
   * OR use blank templates from system documentation  
   * OR use screen captures from vendor training environment  
   * Never use production environment with real PHI for training materials  
4. **NEVER:**

   * Take screenshot of production screen with real patient data "as example"  
   * Share "sanitized" screenshot that might still contain hidden PHI  
   * Assume "just one screenshot for training" is acceptable exception

**Procedure: Respond to Accidental Screenshot Creation**

**If you accidentally take screenshot before realizing:**

1. **Immediate actions:**

   * Delete screenshot file immediately from all locations (screenshot folder, recycle bin, cloud sync folders)  
   * Empty recycle bin / permanently delete  
   * If screenshot was on phone: delete from phone and "Recently Deleted" folder  
2. **Report as incident:**

   * Notify supervisor immediately: "I accidentally took screenshot of PHI screen. I have deleted it completely. Reporting as incident."  
   * Complete incident report per Module 10 procedure  
   * Document: what screen, why screenshot was taken (accidental key press, mistaken troubleshooting attempt), deletion confirmation, device used  
3. **If screenshot was shared before realizing error:**

   * Follow Module 10 incident response  
   * Attempt to recall/delete from recipient (if email)  
   * Notify recipient to delete and not forward  
   * Escalate as potential PHI disclosure incident  
   * Preserve evidence (do not delete sent messages documenting the incident)  
4. **Do NOT:**

   * Keep screenshot "just in case"  
   * Keep screenshot thinking "I already took it, might as well use it"  
   * Keep screenshot with plan to "sanitize it later"

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if anyone asks you to take screenshot of PHI screen — refuse and offer alternatives  
* Stop if you instinctively reach for screenshot tool — pause, use verbal description instead  
* Stop if you see colleague taking screenshots — remind them of prohibition and offer to help find alternative  
* Stop if you accidentally take screenshot — delete immediately and report as incident

**Escalation Path:** Supervisor (for alternative method guidance) → IT (for screen sharing or remote access setup) → Compliance (if pressure to violate policy)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Accidental screenshots documented as incidents (Module 10\)  
* Refusal to take screenshots documented if pressure occurred (safe stop Rule 4 documentation)  
* Alternative methods used documented in tickets/notes ("Demonstrated via screen share session" instead of screenshot attachment)

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- IT Troubleshooting Without Screenshot:** Employee encounters error in billing system. Employee's initial instinct is to screenshot error for IT ticket. Employee stops, remembers prohibition.

Employee creates IT ticket: "I'm in Billing module, Claims Search screen. I enter account number 789456 in the Account Number field (top left), click 'Search' button (top right). System displays error message 'Database connection timeout.' I expect the search results to populate in the grid below. This error occurs consistently for the past 30 minutes across multiple account searches."

IT responds: "Can you schedule a screen share so I can watch you reproduce the error?"

Employee schedules Teams meeting, shares screen in real-time, reproduces error while IT watches. IT identifies configuration issue and resolves.

**Why Compliant:** Used verbal description in ticket, accepted screen share invitation as appropriate alternative, no screenshot created.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Training New Colleague:** Experienced employee asked to show new hire how to process authorization requests.

Employee: "Let's use the training environment so I can demonstrate without using real patient data."

Logs into training environment with fake patient records, walks new hire through entire authorization request process using test data. New hire practices in training environment.

For documentation, employee uses existing training guide screenshots (from training environment, verified PHI-free by training department).

**Why Compliant:** Used test environment for demonstration, referenced approved training materials, no production PHI screens captured.

**Non-Compliant Example (Source Scenarios 5 and Course 3 Scenario 8 Referenced):** Colleague asks: "I'm having trouble with this screen. Can you just take a screenshot and send it to me so I can see what you're seeing?"

Employee: "Sure, here you go." \[Takes screenshot of EHR screen showing patient name, MRN, DOB, diagnosis, and sends via email\]

**Why Non-Compliant:**

* Violated screenshot prohibition (absolute rule, no exceptions)  
* Created uncontrolled PHI copy (screenshot file)  
* Shared PHI via email attachment (additional exposure)  
* Source Scenario 5 explicitly addresses screenshot prohibition  
* Course 3 Scenario 8 reinforces (Order Entry Specialist scenario involves screenshot violation)

**Correct response should have been:** "Our policy prohibits screenshots of PHI screens. I can schedule a quick screen share with you, or I can describe what I'm seeing. What works better for you?"

**Result if violation discovered:** Incident report required, likely sanctions (counseling at minimum, potentially written warning or higher depending on content sensitivity and prior history), mandatory Module 5 refresher, possible restriction on system access pending investigation.

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Screenshot vs Alternative Decision (10 Scenarios)**

For each scenario, identify: (A) Screenshot prohibited, use \[alternative method\], or (B) Screenshot may be allowed (if test environment/blank template)

1. Need to show colleague how to complete form. Production screen with patient data visible. → A \- PROHIBITED (use test environment demonstration or verbal walkthrough)

2. Need to document system error for IT. Error message appears on patient record screen. → A \- PROHIBITED (copy error message text verbally, use screen share, or describe error)

3. Creating training manual. Want to show screen layout. Use training environment with no real patients. → B \- MAY BE ALLOWED (verify training environment is PHI-free, confirm training materials policy allows)

4. Supervisor asks "Can you screenshot that denial code so I can see what you're talking about?" Denial on patient claim screen. → A \- PROHIBITED (describe denial code verbally: "Denial code CO-45: Charge exceeds fee schedule/maximum allowable")

5. Need to show IT where button is located. Button visible on screen with patient account data. → A \- PROHIBITED (describe button location verbally: "Button is top right corner, labeled 'Submit Auth'")

6. Creating job aid for team. Want to show sample workflow. Production screen. → A \- PROHIBITED (use test environment, blank templates from documentation, or text-based instructions)

7. Vendor asks for screenshot to troubleshoot software issue. Patient data visible. → A \- PROHIBITED (describe to vendor or offer screen share session with vendor support; never send screenshot with PHI)

8. Accidentally hit Print Screen key while patient record open. → A \- SCREENSHOT CREATED \- DELETE IMMEDIATELY, REPORT AS INCIDENT

9. Want to show example of correct form completion for training. Blank form template from documentation library, no patient data. → B \- MAY BE ALLOWED (verify completely blank/template)

10. Colleague texts "Send me screenshot of the error." Error on screen with patient MRN visible. → A \- PROHIBITED (explain prohibition to colleague, offer alternatives)

**Scoring:** 100% required (10/10 correct) \- screenshot prohibition is absolute, no partial credit

**Scenario Exercise: Colleague Requests Screenshot**

**Scenario:** Colleague messages you: "Hey, I'm stuck on the authorization screen. Can you take a screenshot of your screen and show me where the Submit button is? I can't find it."

**Your response (write exact words):**

**Sample Compliant Response:** "I can't send screenshots per our policy, but I can help\! The Submit button is in the bottom right corner of the authorization form, below all the diagnosis fields. It's labeled 'Submit for Review.' Does that help? If not, I can do a quick screen share and show you live, or we can hop on a call and I'll walk you through it."

**Why Compliant:**

* Refuses screenshot clearly but helpfully  
* Provides verbal description of button location  
* Offers alternatives (screen share, phone walkthrough)  
* Maintains compliance while being supportive colleague

**Non-Compliant Response:** "Sure, here's a screenshot." \[Sends screenshot of patient authorization screen\]

**Why Non-Compliant:** Violates absolute prohibition; creates incident.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Various requesters  
 **Learner plays:** Employee refusing screenshots and offering alternatives

**Round 1 \- Peer Request:** **Trainer:** "Can you screenshot that screen for me?"

**Learner expected response:** "I can't send screenshots of PHI screens per policy. I can describe what I'm seeing, share my screen in a meeting, or you can remote into my workstation if you have access. Which works for you?"

**Round 2 \- Supervisor Request:** **Trainer (as supervisor):** "I need you to screenshot that denial and email it to me right away."

**Learner expected response:** "Our policy prohibits screenshots of PHI screens. I can forward you the denial details in the ticket, schedule a screen share so you can see it directly, or describe the denial code and reason. Would one of those work?"

**Round 3 \- Urgent Pressure:** **Trainer:** "This is urgent\! Just take a quick screenshot, no one will know\!"

**Learner expected response:** "I understand the urgency, but I cannot take screenshots of PHI screens under any circumstance, including urgent situations. Let's find an alternative solution right now. Can you view my screen remotely or can I read you the information you need?"

\[If pressure continues, learner escalates to compliance per safe stop Rule 4\]

**Checklist: Screenshot Prohibition Compliance**

* \[ \] Never takes screenshots of PHI screens  
* \[ \] Uses verbal descriptions for troubleshooting  
* \[ \] Uses approved screen sharing for demonstrations  
* \[ \] Uses test environment for training when possible  
* \[ \] Refuses screenshot requests professionally  
* \[ \] Offers alternatives when screenshot requested  
* \[ \] Deletes immediately if accidental screenshot occurs  
* \[ \] Reports accidental screenshots as incidents  
* \[ \] Escalates if pressured to violate prohibition

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Decision drill (10 scenarios): 5 points (10/10 \= 100% required for screenshot prohibition absolutes)  
* Refusal script: 3 points (clear refusal \+ alternatives offered)  
* Alternative methods knowledge: 2 points  
* **Total: 10 points (10/10 \= 100% passing for this critical safety module)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (15 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Screenshots of PHI screens are: A) Allowed for training purposes  
 B) Allowed if sent to supervisor  
 C) Allowed in emergencies  
 D) Absolutely prohibited with no exceptions

**Answer:** D  
 **Rationale:** Screenshot prohibition is absolute; no exceptions for purpose, recipient, or urgency.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — training does not exempt; use test environment.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Appropriate alternative to screenshot for IT troubleshooting: A) Take screenshot but encrypt it  
 B) Use phone camera instead  
 C) Verbal description or approved screen sharing  
 D) Screenshot and immediately delete after sending

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Verbal description or screen sharing provides help without creating uncontrolled PHI file.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — encryption doesn't address uncontrolled copy issue.

**Item 3 (True/False):** If supervisor requests screenshot of patient screen, you must comply since they're your supervisor.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Screenshot prohibition applies regardless of requester; refuse and offer alternatives.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — not understanding that policy overrides supervisor request.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** You accidentally take screenshot of patient record screen. What do you do? A) Keep it but don't share it  
 B) Delete immediately, report as incident  
 C) Save for later in case needed  
 D) Sanitize patient info and keep template

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Immediate deletion and incident reporting required.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — "sanitizing" screenshot is not acceptable; delete entirely.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Colleague asks you to screenshot error message showing on patient claim screen. You should: A) Take screenshot and send it  
 B) Refuse; describe error message text verbally instead  
 C) Take screenshot but blur patient info  
 D) Screenshot only the error message area

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Refuse screenshot (prohibited); describe error message text as alternative.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — "only part of screen" doesn't eliminate prohibition if PHI present anywhere on screen.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Test environment screenshots are: A) Always allowed  
 B) May be allowed if verified PHI-free and policy permits  
 C) Prohibited like production screenshots  
 D) Only allowed for IT

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Test environment screenshots may be permitted if no real PHI and training materials policy allows (needs\_review).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — still requires verification of PHI absence and policy check.

**Item 7 (True/False):** Phone camera photos of computer screens are included in screenshot prohibition.

**Answer:** True  
 **Rationale:** Phone camera capture creates same uncontrolled PHI copy problem; included in prohibition.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** Approved screen sharing differs from screenshot because: A) It's the same thing  
 B) It's temporary real-time display, not permanent file creation  
 C) It requires password  
 D) Only supervisors can screen share

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Screen sharing is temporary display with session controls; screenshot creates permanent file.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — password is control feature but not the core distinction.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** You need to train new hire on authorization process. Best method: A) Screenshot each step from production environment  
 B) Use test environment demonstration with fake patient data  
 C) Screenshot production but remove patient names  
 D) Video record your screen with production data

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Test environment allows demonstration without real PHI exposure.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — "removing names" doesn't fully address screenshot prohibition and leaves other identifiers.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Vendor asks for screenshot to troubleshoot software issue affecting patient record display. You should: A) Provide screenshot since vendor needs it  
 B) Refuse; offer verbal description or screen share session with vendor support  
 C) Screenshot and redact patient info first  
 D) Get supervisor permission then screenshot

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Prohibition applies to vendor requests; use alternatives.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — vendor need doesn't override prohibition.

**Item 11 (True/False):** "Just one quick screenshot for urgent troubleshooting" is an acceptable exception to the prohibition.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** No exceptions for urgency; prohibition is absolute.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — rationalizing exception for urgent situations.

**Item 12 (MCQ):** Source Scenarios 5 and Course 3 Scenario 8 address: A) Password sharing  
 B) Screenshot prohibition violations  
 C) Email security  
 D) Access controls

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Both scenarios explicitly address screenshot violations and appropriate alternatives.

**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** You see colleague taking screenshot of patient billing screen. What do you do? A) Nothing, not your concern  
 B) Remind colleague of prohibition and offer to help find alternative method  
 C) Report colleague immediately without speaking to them  
 D) Take screenshot yourself to show them how it's done

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Peer accountability; remind of policy and help find compliant alternative.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — direct intervention and education before formal reporting is appropriate for peer violations.

**Item 14 (Short Answer):** List three alternatives to screenshots for troubleshooting or training.

**Answer:** (Any three of: verbal description, approved screen sharing, test environment demonstration, remote access by IT/supervisor, written step-by-step instructions, existing training documentation/videos, blank templates from vendor documentation)

**Item 15 (MCQ):** Screenshot prohibition exists because screenshots: A) Take up storage space  
 B) Create uncontrolled PHI copies that persist, can be accidentally shared, and are difficult to secure or permanently delete  
 C) Violate copyright  
 D) Slow down computers

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Core security concern is uncontrolled PHI file creation and persistence.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — storage is minor concern compared to PHI control issue.

# **ADDITIONAL COMPLETE MODULE BUILDS (CONTINUED)**

## **COURSE 4: MEDICAL SCRIBE TRAINING (REMOTE, CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION QUALITY)**

### **MODULE 2: SOAP NOTE STRUCTURE FUNDAMENTALS (90 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) is the universal clinical documentation structure. Your role as scribe is documenting provider's observations and decisions in correct SOAP sections — NOT interpreting, inferring, or adding information the provider didn't state. This module trains each section's purpose and content boundaries: Subjective (patient-reported symptoms/history), Objective (measurable findings/exam results), Assessment (provider's clinical conclusions), Plan (treatment decisions). Documentation-only scope means you transcribe what provider says; you never fill gaps with assumptions or medical knowledge.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Places documentation in correct SOAP section based on information type  
* Distinguishes patient-reported information (Subjective) from provider observations (Objective)  
* Records provider's assessment and plan exactly as stated, no interpretation  
* Escalates when provider's dictation is unclear or ambiguous  
* Never adds information provider didn't explicitly state  
* Uses consistent SOAP structure across all encounter types

#### **2\) Definitions**

**SOAP Structure:** Standardized clinical note format with four sections: Subjective (patient's report), Objective (provider's findings), Assessment (provider's clinical judgment), Plan (treatment decisions). Used across specialties for consistency.

**Subjective Section:** Patient-reported information including chief complaint, history of present illness, symptoms, symptom characteristics (onset, duration, severity, location, quality, alleviating/aggravating factors), review of systems (patient's yes/no responses), past medical/surgical/family/social history, medications, allergies. First-person patient perspective.

**Objective Section:** Provider's observations and measurable findings including vital signs, physical examination findings, test results (labs, imaging, diagnostics), observed patient behavior/appearance, wound measurements, functional assessments. Third-person provider observations.

**Assessment Section:** Provider's clinical reasoning, differential diagnoses, diagnosis conclusions, evaluation of patient's condition/progress. Provider's professional judgment based on subjective and objective data. Examples: "Patient presents with acute bronchitis," "Type 2 diabetes well-controlled," "Hypertension poorly controlled, medication adjustment needed."

**Plan Section:** Provider's treatment decisions and next steps including new/continued/discontinued medications with dosing, procedures performed or ordered, diagnostic tests ordered, referrals, patient education provided, follow-up instructions, return precautions. Actionable items.

**Chief Complaint (CC):** Brief statement of why patient is seeking care, typically in patient's own words. Example: "cough and fever for 3 days." Placed at beginning of Subjective or as separate header.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):** Detailed narrative of current problem including symptom timeline, characteristics, previous treatments attempted, impact on daily activities. Core of Subjective section.

**Review of Systems (ROS):** Systematic review of body systems where patient reports presence or absence of symptoms. Can be in Subjective (patient-reported) or documented as separate section. Example: "Cardiovascular: denies chest pain, palpitations. Respiratory: positive for cough, denies shortness of breath."

**Physical Examination:** Provider's systematic assessment of body systems through inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation. Core of Objective section. Example: "Lungs: bilateral crackles at bases, no wheezes. Heart: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs."

**Documentation-Only Scope:** Scribe role limitation: transcribe provider's stated observations and decisions exactly; do NOT interpret clinical meaning, infer unstated information, or apply medical knowledge to fill gaps.

**Hallucinated Facts:** Information added to documentation that provider did not explicitly state. Serious violation. Example: Provider says "lungs clear," scribe writes "no wheezes, rhonchi, or rales" (adding detail provider didn't state). Even if medically accurate, scribes document ONLY what provider states.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Document Chief Complaint and Subjective Section**

1. **Capture Chief Complaint (CC):**

   * Listen for patient's initial statement of problem  
   * Document in patient's words when possible: "Patient reports: 'cough and fever'"  
   * Keep brief (typically 1-3 words to one sentence)  
   * Place at note beginning or Subjective section header  
2. **Document History of Present Illness (HPI):**

   * Record patient's description of current problem in chronological order  
   * Include symptom characteristics (use patient's descriptive words):  
     * Onset: when symptoms started ("3 days ago," "gradually over past week")  
     * Location: where symptom occurs ("right knee," "left chest")  
     * Duration: how long symptoms last ("constant," "intermittent lasting 2-3 hours")  
     * Character/Quality: what symptom feels like (patient's words: "sharp," "dull ache," "burning")  
     * Severity: intensity (patient's rating: "7 out of 10," "mild," "severe")  
     * Aggravating factors: what makes worse ("walking upstairs," "eating")  
     * Alleviating factors: what makes better ("rest," "ibuprofen")  
     * Associated symptoms: related symptoms ("cough with fever," "nausea with headache")  
   * Include treatments tried: "Patient tried over-the-counter ibuprofen with minimal relief"  
   * Record impact on function: "Unable to attend work for past 2 days"  
3. **Document Review of Systems (ROS):**

   * Record patient's positive and negative responses to system review  
   * Use consistent format per provider preference:  
     * By system: "Cardiovascular: denies chest pain. Respiratory: positive for cough."  
     * OR comprehensive paragraph: "Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain. Positive for cough, fever, fatigue."  
   * Mark pertinent negatives (symptoms patient does NOT have that are clinically relevant)  
   * Only document systems provider specifically asks about (don't assume unmentioned systems were reviewed)  
4. **Document Past Medical/Surgical/Family/Social History (if addressed in encounter):**

   * Past Medical History (PMH): chronic conditions patient reports having  
   * Past Surgical History (PSH): previous surgeries with approximate dates  
   * Family History (FH): relevant conditions in immediate family members  
   * Social History (SH): occupation, smoking/alcohol/drug use, living situation (document exactly what patient reports, use neutral language)  
   * Medications: current medications patient reports taking (name, dose, frequency)  
   * Allergies: medication allergies and reactions patient reports  
5. **Safe stops for Subjective section:**

   * If patient statement is unclear: ask provider to clarify or note "patient reports \[unclear statement\]"  
   * If you cannot understand patient's description: ask provider to restate or interpret  
   * Never assume symptom characteristics provider didn't explicitly confirm with patient  
   * Never add "likely" or "probably" descriptions (clinical interpretation exceeds scope)

**Procedure: Document Objective Section**

1. **Document Vital Signs:**

   * Record all vitals taken: BP (blood pressure), HR (heart rate), RR (respiratory rate), Temp (temperature), O2 sat (oxygen saturation), Wt (weight), Ht (height), BMI if calculated  
   * Include method/location if provider specifies: "BP 130/80 left arm, sitting"  
   * Use exact numbers provider states; do not round or estimate  
2. **Document Physical Examination:**

   * Record examination in systematic order per provider's exam sequence  
   * Use provider's exact descriptive words for findings:  
     * Provider says: "lungs clear bilaterally" → Document: "Lungs clear bilaterally"  
     * Provider says: "2/6 systolic murmur at apex" → Document exactly that  
   * Include negative findings provider explicitly states: "No rashes noted," "Abdomen soft, non-tender"  
   * Do NOT expand provider's statements with additional medical terminology  
   * Do NOT add examination elements provider didn't perform or mention  
   * Common exam documentation format by system:  
     * General appearance: "Alert, no acute distress" or "Ill-appearing"  
     * HEENT (Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat): exam findings  
     * Cardiovascular: heart exam findings  
     * Respiratory: lung exam findings  
     * Abdomen: abdominal exam findings  
     * Extremities: findings in arms/legs  
     * Neurological: mental status, motor, sensory findings  
     * Skin: any skin lesions, wounds, rashes observed  
3. **Document Test Results and Measurements:**

   * Record any diagnostic results reviewed during encounter:  
     * Lab values: "Glucose 145, A1C 7.2%"  
     * Imaging results: "Chest X-ray: no acute infiltrates per radiology report"  
     * Point-of-care testing: "Rapid strep: negative"  
   * Record objective measurements: "Wound measures 3 cm x 2 cm"  
   * Include reference ranges if provider mentions: "WBC 12,000 (elevated)"  
4. **Safe stops for Objective section:**

   * If provider's exam finding description is unclear: ask provider to repeat or clarify  
   * If you're uncertain which body system an exam finding belongs to: ask provider  
   * Never infer exam findings from Assessment section (if provider assesses "clear lungs" but didn't state lung exam findings, do NOT add "lungs clear" to Objective)  
   * Never document exam elements provider didn't perform (don't write "normal" for systems not examined)

**Procedure: Document Assessment Section**

1. **Listen for provider's clinical conclusions:**

   * Diagnoses stated by provider (primary and secondary diagnoses)  
   * Provider's evaluation of patient's condition or progress  
   * Differential diagnoses provider is considering  
   * Clinical reasoning provider verbalizes  
2. **Document provider's assessment statements exactly:**

   * Use provider's diagnostic language: "Acute bronchitis," "Type 2 diabetes mellitus, well-controlled"  
   * Include any qualifying statements: "likely viral upper respiratory infection," "rule out pneumonia"  
   * Number multiple diagnoses if provider does: "1. Hypertension, poorly controlled. 2\. Obesity."  
   * Record assessment of existing conditions: "Diabetes management improving with current regimen"  
3. **Do NOT:**

   * Infer diagnoses from symptoms or exam findings (if provider examined diabetic foot ulcer but didn't state "diabetic foot ulcer" as diagnosis, don't add it)  
   * Add ICD-10 codes (coding is separate role; you document diagnosis in words)  
   * Reword provider's assessment using medical terminology you know (document provider's exact language level)  
   * Add clinical reasoning provider didn't verbalize  
4. **Safe stops for Assessment:**

   * If provider's diagnosis statement is ambiguous or incomplete: ask provider to clarify or complete  
   * If provider uses unfamiliar diagnosis term: ask provider to spell or clarify (use 200-term job aid for common terms)  
   * If provider hasn't stated diagnosis but has stated plan: note to provider "Diagnosis for documentation?"

**Procedure: Document Plan Section**

1. **Document treatment decisions in organized categories:**

    **Medications:**

   * New prescriptions: "Start amoxicillin 500mg three times daily for 10 days"  
   * Medication changes: "Increase lisinopril from 10mg to 20mg daily"  
   * Continued medications: "Continue metformin 1000mg twice daily"  
   * Discontinued medications: "Discontinue hydrochlorothiazide"  
   * Include route if specified: "oral," "topical," "inhaled"  
2. **Procedures/Treatments:**

   * Procedures performed in office: "Wound cleaned and dressed with Xeroform and gauze"  
   * Treatments ordered: "Physical therapy 3x/week for 4 weeks"  
3. **Diagnostic Testing:**

   * Labs ordered: "Order CBC, CMP, lipid panel \- fasting"  
   * Imaging ordered: "Order chest X-ray, 2 views"  
   * Timing if specified: "Labs to be drawn in 3 months"  
4. **Referrals:**

   * Specialty referrals: "Refer to cardiology for stress test evaluation"  
   * Include urgency if stated: "urgent cardiology referral"  
5. **Patient Education:**

   * Instructions given to patient: "Discussed importance of smoking cessation"  
   * Self-care instructions: "Apply ice 20 minutes 3x/day"  
   * Diet/activity modifications: "Low-sodium diet recommended"  
6. **Follow-up:**

   * Return visit timing: "Follow up in 2 weeks"  
   * Precautions: "Return sooner if fever worsens or shortness of breath develops"  
   * Results notification: "Will call patient with lab results in 3-5 days"  
7. **Use clear, actionable language:**

   * Each plan item should be specific action: "Order X," "Start Y," "Refer to Z"  
   * Include timeframes when provider specifies  
   * Include quantities/durations for prescriptions  
8. **Safe stops for Plan:**

   * If medication dosing incomplete: prompt provider "Dose and frequency for \[medication\]?"  
   * If follow-up timing unclear: ask provider to specify  
   * If unclear whether medication is new, changed, or continued: clarify with provider  
   * Never assume plan elements provider didn't state (don't add "follow up PRN" if provider didn't mention follow-up)

**Safe Stop Rules (Universal for SOAP):**

* Stop if provider's dictation is unclear, ambiguous, or incomplete — request clarification  
* Stop if you're unsure which SOAP section information belongs in — ask provider  
* Stop if you're tempted to add information provider didn't state — escalate, document only what's stated  
* Stop if provider uses terminology you don't understand — ask for spelling/clarification using 200-term job aid

**Escalation Path:** Provider (for immediate clarification during encounter) → Supervising scribe coordinator (for documentation structure questions) → Compliance (for scope boundary questions)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Every clinical encounter documented in complete SOAP format  
* All four sections present (even if brief)  
* Timestamps for note creation and any amendments  
* Electronic signature or attestation by provider after scribe completes note

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- Complete SOAP Note (Simplified):**

**CHIEF COMPLAINT:** Cough and fever

**SUBJECTIVE:** Patient is a 45-year-old female presenting with cough and fever for 3 days. Cough is productive with yellow sputum. Fever up to 101°F. Associated symptoms include fatigue and mild shortness of breath with exertion. Denies chest pain. Tried over-the-counter cough syrup with minimal relief. No recent sick contacts known. Symptoms interfering with work.

Review of Systems: Respiratory: positive for cough, fever, shortness of breath with exertion. Negative for chest pain, wheezing. Cardiovascular: denies chest pain, palpitations.

**OBJECTIVE:** Vitals: BP 128/76, HR 88, RR 18, Temp 100.8°F, O2 sat 97% on room air

General: Alert, no acute distress  
 HEENT: Oropharynx clear, no erythema  
 Lungs: Scattered rhonchi bilaterally, no wheezes, good air movement  
 Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs  
 Extremities: No edema

**ASSESSMENT:** Acute bronchitis

**PLAN:**

1. Supportive care with rest and hydration  
2. Start benzonatate 100mg three times daily as needed for cough  
3. Continue over-the-counter acetaminophen for fever  
4. Patient educated on expected course and return precautions  
5. Return in 7-10 days if not improving or sooner if develops worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or high fever

**Why Compliant:** Complete SOAP structure, information placed in correct sections (patient reports in Subjective, provider's exam in Objective, provider's diagnosis in Assessment, provider's treatment decisions in Plan), no hallucinated facts, all information directly from provider's statements during encounter.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Distinguishing Subjective vs Objective:**

**Provider dictates:** "Patient says his right knee is swollen and painful. On exam, right knee shows moderate effusion and tenderness to palpation."

**Scribe documents:**

**SUBJECTIVE (partial):** Right knee swelling and pain per patient report.

**OBJECTIVE (partial):** Right knee: moderate effusion noted, tender to palpation.

**Why Compliant:** Patient's report ("says swollen and painful") documented in Subjective. Provider's examination findings ("shows effusion," "tender to palpation") documented in Objective. Clear separation between patient-reported and provider-observed.

**Non-Compliant Example \- Hallucinated Facts:**

**Provider dictates:** "Lungs are clear."

**Scribe documents:** "Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Good air movement throughout all lung fields."

**Why Non-Compliant:** Provider said only "lungs are clear." Scribe added:

* "to auscultation bilaterally" (provider didn't specify method)  
* "no wheezes, rhonchi, or rales" (provider didn't list these negative findings)  
* "Good air movement throughout all lung fields" (provider didn't state this)

Even though these additions are medically consistent with "clear lungs," they are hallucinated facts — information scribe added that provider didn't state. Violates documentation-only scope.

**Correct documentation:** "Lungs: Clear." (Exactly what provider stated, nothing more)

**Result if hallucinated facts discovered:** Coaching on documentation-only scope, note correction required, potential note audit to check for pattern, refresher training if pattern continues. Hallucinated facts can create false clinical record and liability risk.

**Non-Compliant Example 2 \- Wrong SOAP Section:**

**Provider dictates:** "Patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes."

**Scribe documents in Objective section:** "Patient has history of hypertension and diabetes."

**Why Non-Compliant:** Historical information (past medical history) belongs in Subjective section (patient's history), not Objective section (provider's current observations). Misplacement makes note harder to read and violates SOAP structure convention.

**Correct placement:** Document in Subjective section: "Past Medical History: Hypertension, diabetes mellitus."

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: SOAP Section Placement (20 Items)**

For each statement, identify correct SOAP section: S (Subjective), O (Objective), A (Assessment), P (Plan)

1. "Patient reports headache for 2 days" → S (patient-reported symptom)  
2. "Blood pressure 140/90" → O (objective measurement)  
3. "Hypertension, poorly controlled" → A (diagnosis/clinical conclusion)  
4. "Increase lisinopril to 20mg daily" → P (treatment decision)  
5. "Patient denies chest pain" → S (patient-reported negative)  
6. "Heart: Regular rate and rhythm" → O (physical exam finding)  
7. "Type 2 diabetes, well-controlled" → A (diagnosis assessment)  
8. "Order A1C and lipid panel" → P (diagnostic test order)  
9. "Cough productive with yellow sputum per patient" → S (patient description)  
10. "Lungs: bilateral crackles at bases" → O (exam finding)  
11. "Likely viral upper respiratory infection" → A (diagnosis or differential)  
12. "Patient educated on smoking cessation" → P (patient education provided)  
13. "Patient tried ibuprofen with minimal relief" → S (patient's history of treatment attempts)  
14. "Temperature 101.2°F" → O (vital sign)  
15. "Acute bronchitis" → A (diagnosis)  
16. "Follow up in 2 weeks" → P (follow-up instruction)  
17. "Patient rates pain 7 out of 10" → S (patient-reported severity)  
18. "Abdomen soft, non-tender" → O (exam finding)  
19. "Diabetes management improving with current regimen" → A (assessment of condition)  
20. "Continue metformin 1000mg twice daily" → P (medication continuation)

**Scoring:** 80% \= 16/20 correct

**Scenario Exercise: Identify Hallucinated Facts**

**Provider states:** "Patient has diabetes and hypertension. Blood pressure today is 150/95. I'll increase his blood pressure medication."

**Scribe drafts (identify problems):**

"**SUBJECTIVE:** Patient presents for diabetes and hypertension management. Reports compliance with medications and checking blood sugar regularly at home with good control.

**OBJECTIVE:** BP 150/95, elevated compared to goal of less than 130/80. Patient appears well-nourished and in no distress.

**ASSESSMENT:** Type 2 diabetes mellitus, well-controlled. Hypertension, poorly controlled.

**PLAN:** Increase lisinopril from 10mg to 20mg daily. Patient educated on importance of blood pressure control to prevent complications. Follow up in 1 month to recheck blood pressure."

**Identify hallucinated facts (information provider didn't state):**

**Answer \- Hallucinated Facts:**

1. "Reports compliance with medications" — provider didn't state this  
2. "checking blood sugar regularly at home with good control" — provider didn't state this  
3. "compared to goal of less than 130/80" — provider didn't state goal  
4. "appears well-nourished" — provider didn't state this  
5. "in no distress" — provider didn't state this  
6. "Type 2 diabetes mellitus, well-controlled" — provider only said "diabetes," didn't specify type or control status  
7. "poorly controlled" for hypertension — provider didn't state this assessment  
8. "from 10mg to 20mg" — provider said "increase blood pressure medication" but didn't specify medication name or new dose  
9. "educated on importance of blood pressure control to prevent complications" — provider didn't state what education was provided  
10. "Follow up in 1 month to recheck blood pressure" — provider didn't state follow-up timing or purpose

**Correct documentation based ONLY on provider's statements:**

"**SUBJECTIVE:** Patient presents for diabetes and hypertension management.

**OBJECTIVE:** BP 150/95

**ASSESSMENT:** Diabetes. Hypertension.

**PLAN:** Increase blood pressure medication."

**Note:** This correct version is incomplete for clinical purposes. Scribe should prompt provider: "Dose for blood pressure medication? Type of diabetes? Assessment of diabetes control? Follow-up timing?" Provider then provides additional information to complete note. Scribe's role is prompting for completeness, NOT filling gaps with assumptions.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Provider dictating encounter  
 **Learner plays:** Scribe documenting in real-time

**Provider dictates:** "Patient is a 60-year-old male with chest pain for one hour. Pain is substernal, pressure-like, radiating to left arm. On exam, patient is diaphoretic and appears anxious. Vital signs: BP 160/100, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 20\. Heart exam shows regular rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs clear. I'm concerned about acute coronary syndrome. EKG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. I'm calling for ambulance transfer to emergency department for STEMI protocol."

**Learner expected actions:**

* Document chief complaint: "Chest pain"  
* **SUBJECTIVE:** "Chest pain for one hour. Pain substernal, pressure-like, radiating to left arm."  
* **OBJECTIVE:** "Patient diaphoretic, appears anxious. Vitals: BP 160/100, HR 110, RR 20\. Heart: Regular rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs: Clear. EKG: ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF."  
* **ASSESSMENT:** "Acute coronary syndrome. STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction)."  
* **PLAN:** "Ambulance transfer to emergency department for STEMI protocol."  
* Document urgency and time-critical nature accurately  
* Do NOT add clinical details provider didn't state (e.g., don't add "troponin elevated" if provider didn't mention labs)

**Checklist: SOAP Documentation Discipline**

* \[ \] Chief complaint documented (brief, patient's words when possible)  
* \[ \] Subjective section contains patient-reported information only  
* \[ \] Objective section contains provider's observations and measurable findings only  
* \[ \] Assessment section contains provider's diagnoses and clinical conclusions only  
* \[ \] Plan section contains provider's treatment decisions and next steps only  
* \[ \] No hallucinated facts (only information provider explicitly stated)  
* \[ \] No clinical interpretation or inference added  
* \[ \] Complete sections (all four SOAP sections present)  
* \[ \] Prompts provider for clarification when dictation unclear or incomplete  
* \[ \] Uses provider's exact terminology and language level

**Scoring Rubric:**

* SOAP section placement (20 items): 4 points (16/20 \= 80%)  
* Hallucinated facts identification: 3 points (identifies majority of added information)  
* Real-time documentation simulation: 3 points (correct section placement, no hallucinated facts, appropriate prompting)  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (20 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** SOAP stands for: A) System, Observation, Analysis, Procedure  
 B) Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan  
 C) Symptom, Objective, Assessment, Prescription

**Item 6 (Scenario MCQ):** Provider says "Patient has diabetes and I'm going to start insulin." Scribe documents: "Assessment: Type 2 diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled. Plan: Start insulin glargine 10 units at bedtime." What is the problem? A) No problem, appropriately documented  
 B) Scribe added "Type 2" and "uncontrolled" and specific insulin details provider didn't state (hallucinated facts)  
 C) Used wrong SOAP sections  
 D) Too brief

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Provider said only "diabetes" (not Type 2\) and "start insulin" (not specific type or dose). Scribe added unstated details.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — not recognizing added specificity as hallucinated facts.

**Item 7 (MCQ):** Documentation-only scope means: A) Write everything you think is important  
 B) Transcribe provider's stated observations and decisions exactly, no interpretation or added information  
 C) Document using medical terminology you learned in training  
 D) Fill gaps in provider's dictation using medical knowledge

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Documentation-only \= transcribe exactly what provider states, nothing more.

**Item 8 (True/False):** If provider assesses "hypertension" in Assessment section but didn't mention blood pressure in Objective section, scribe should add "BP elevated" to Objective section to support the Assessment.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Cannot infer objective findings from assessment; document only what provider explicitly states in each section.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — trying to make note internally consistent crosses boundary.

**Item 9 (MCQ):** "Acute bronchitis" belongs in which section? A) Subjective  
 B) Objective  
 C) Assessment  
 D) Plan

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Diagnosis \= Assessment (provider's clinical conclusion).

**Item 10 (MCQ):** "Start amoxicillin 500mg three times daily for 10 days" belongs in which section? A) Subjective  
 B) Objective  
 C) Assessment  
 D) Plan

**Answer:** D  
 **Rationale:** Medication prescription \= Plan (treatment decision).

**Item 11 (Scenario MCQ):** Provider dictates: "Patient says knee is swollen. On exam, moderate effusion present." Which statement is correct? A) Both statements go in Objective  
 B) "Patient says knee is swollen" goes in Subjective; "moderate effusion present" goes in Objective  
 C) Both statements go in Subjective  
 D) Both statements go in Assessment

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Patient's report (Subjective) vs provider's examination finding (Objective) must be separated.

**Item 12 (MCQ):** Hallucinated facts are: A) Incorrect medical information  
 B) Information scribe adds that provider didn't explicitly state  
 C) Imaginary patients  
 D) Errors in vital signs

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Hallucinated facts \= added information, even if medically accurate, that provider didn't state.

**Item 13 (True/False):** Scribe role includes interpreting ambiguous provider statements using medical knowledge to complete documentation.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Scribe does NOT interpret; escalates ambiguities to provider for clarification.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — believing medical knowledge allows interpretation.

**Item 14 (MCQ):** Provider says "Follow up in clinic." Scribe documents "Follow up in 2 weeks for recheck." What is the problem? A) No problem  
 B) Scribe added "2 weeks" and "recheck" that provider didn't state  
 C) Follow-up should be in Assessment  
 D) Should use different wording

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Provider didn't specify timing or purpose; scribe should prompt provider to complete ("Follow up timing?").

**Item 15 (MCQ):** If provider's dictation is unclear, scribe should: A) Use best judgment to complete  
 B) Leave section blank  
 C) Ask provider to clarify or repeat  
 D) Research correct terminology

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Prompt provider for clarification; don't guess or research independently during encounter.

**Item 16 (Scenario MCQ):** Provider examines heart and says "regular rhythm." Scribe knows provider typically documents "regular rate and rhythm." Scribe should document: A) "Regular rhythm" (what provider said)  
 B) "Regular rate and rhythm" (provider's typical phrasing)  
 C) "RRR" (abbreviation for regular rate and rhythm)  
 D) Ask provider if they meant "rate and rhythm"

**Answer:** A (or D if prompting for completeness)  
 **Rationale:** Document exactly what provider stated. May prompt for completeness: "Regular rhythm \- should I add rate?" But default is document only what was stated.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** B — adding "rate" because "typical" crosses into hallucinated facts.

**Item 17 (MCQ):** Review of Systems (ROS) typically belongs in: A) Subjective section (patient-reported symptoms)  
 B) Objective section  
 C) Assessment section  
 D) Plan section

**Answer:** A  
 **Rationale:** ROS is patient's report of symptoms by system \= Subjective. (Note: Some formats place ROS as separate section, but conceptually it's patient-reported data.)

**Item 18 (True/False):** Scribe can add ICD-10 diagnosis codes to Assessment section to help with billing.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Coding is separate role; scribes document diagnosis in words, coders assign codes.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — confusing scribe role with coder role.

**Item 19 (Short Answer):** Provider says "Lungs have crackles." Where do you document this and what exact words do you use?

**Answer:** Objective section. Document: "Lungs: Crackles present." OR "Lungs: Crackles." (Use provider's exact words, no additions)

**Item 20 (MCQ):** Most serious violation of scribe documentation-only scope is: A) Typos in note  
 B) Hallucinating facts (adding information provider didn't state)  
 C) Using abbreviations  
 D) Formatting inconsistency

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Hallucinated facts create false clinical record; serious liability and accuracy violation.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — abbreviations are style issue, not scope violation.

#### **7\) QA and Audit Hooks**

**Evidence of Competence:**

* SOAP section placement drill (20 items, 16/20 \= 80%)  
* Hallucinated facts identification exercise (score 80%+ on identifying added information)  
* Real-time documentation simulation scored by rubric (correct sections, no hallucinated facts, appropriate prompting)  
* Knowledge check (20 items, 16/20 \= 80%)

**Supervisor Review Checklist:**

* \[ \] Learner places information in correct SOAP sections consistently  
* \[ \] Learner documents only what provider explicitly states (no hallucinated facts)  
* \[ \] Learner prompts provider for clarification when dictation unclear or incomplete  
* \[ \] Learner uses provider's exact terminology and language level  
* \[ \] Learner distinguishes patient-reported (Subjective) from provider-observed (Objective)

## **COURSE 6: SUPPORTING ROLES BOOTCAMP (PODS-BASED, UPLIFT-SPECIFIC)**

### **MODULE 3: HANDOFF PROTOCOLS AND CONTEXT TRANSFER (75 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Handoffs (transferring work to another team member) are high-risk moments for communication failure, lost context, duplicated effort, or dropped tasks. Clean handoffs require: structured format (who/what/when/why/next), complete context transfer (enough information for recipient to continue without questions), documentation in system (handoff recorded, not just verbal), verification (recipient confirms understanding), and follow-through tracking (original owner confirms completion). Poor handoffs cause patient impact (delayed care, billing errors, missed authorizations), operational waste (rework, confusion), and team friction.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Uses standardized handoff template for all work transfers  
* Provides complete context (account details, actions taken, current status, next steps, dependencies)  
* Documents handoff in ticketing system or tracking tool  
* Verifies recipient understands handoff before releasing ownership  
* Follows up to confirm handoff completion  
* Never assumes "someone will figure it out" \- explicit handoff required

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Handoff:** Transfer of task responsibility from one team member to another, including all context needed for recipient to continue work without gaps.

**Clean Handoff:** Structured handoff with complete information, documented trail, and verification. Recipient can proceed without additional questions or context-seeking.

**Dirty Handoff:** Incomplete, undocumented, or ambiguous handoff requiring recipient to chase information, guess at context, or duplicate prior work. Causes delays and errors.

**Handoff Template:** Standardized format ensuring consistent information transfer. Typical elements: Account/patient identifier, Task description, Actions already taken, Current status, Next steps required, Deadline/urgency, Dependencies/blockers, Contact for questions.

**Context Transfer:** Sharing relevant background information recipient needs: prior communications, attempts made, issues encountered, decisions pending, stakeholder contacts. Prevents recipient from "starting over."

**Handoff Documentation:** Recording handoff in system of record (ticket, case management system, handoff log) creating audit trail and preventing "he said/she said" confusion.

**Verification:** Recipient confirms understanding of handoff by restating key points or asking clarifying questions. Sender confirms recipient is ready to proceed.

**Follow-Through:** Original sender checks that handoff completed successfully, especially for urgent or complex items. Not micromanagement \- accountability for outcome.

**Hot Handoff:** Urgent transfer requiring immediate action (patient waiting, deadline today, escalated issue). Requires real-time communication (phone/chat) not just ticket update.

**Cold Handoff:** Non-urgent transfer via documented system, recipient works on timeline appropriate to priority. Most common handoff type.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Execute Standard Handoff (Cold Handoff)**

1. **Prepare handoff using template** (needs\_review for client-specific template, general structure below):

    **WHO:**

   * Account/Patient identifier (account number, MRN, claim number \- use minimum necessary)  
   * Recipient team/person (which pod, which specialist, which supervisor)  
2. **WHAT:**

   * Task description: What needs to be done?  
   * Category: Authorization, claim review, denial appeal, payment posting, verification, etc.  
3. **WHEN:**

   * Deadline or target completion date  
   * Urgency level (routine, priority, urgent)  
4. **WHY (Context):**

   * Reason for task: "Patient requesting auth status," "Claim denied, needs appeal review," "Payment discrepancy reported"  
   * Actions already taken: "Called payer 3/15, confirmed auth pending. Called payer again 3/17, received auth number 123456."  
   * Current status: "Auth approved, number received, needs entry into system"  
   * Issues/blockers encountered: "Payer required additional clinical notes, obtained from provider 3/16"  
5. **NEXT STEPS:**

   * Exactly what recipient should do: "Enter auth number 123456 into system for account 789\. Notify patient of approval."  
   * Dependencies: "Waiting for provider to complete form before submitting" OR "All documents complete, ready to submit"  
   * Expected outcome: "Auth entered, patient notified, close case"  
6. **CONTACT:**

   * Who to contact with questions: Your name, extension, email  
   * Stakeholder contacts if relevant: "Patient cell: \[number\], provider office: \[number\]"  
7. **Document handoff in system:**

   * Update ticket/case status: "Handed off to \[recipient\]"  
   * Attach handoff template or paste into ticket notes  
   * Assign ticket to recipient user or queue  
   * Set appropriate priority/due date flags  
8. **Communicate handoff:**

   * For routine (cold) handoffs: System documentation sufficient, no separate communication needed  
   * For priority handoffs: Send message to recipient: "Assigned \[ticket/case\] to you, please review by \[date\]"  
   * For urgent (hot) handoffs: See hot handoff procedure below  
9. **Verify receipt (for priority/urgent):**

   * For priority items: Check recipient acknowledges within 1 business day  
   * For urgent items: Require immediate acknowledgment (within 1 hour or per policy)  
10. **Release ownership mentally:**

    * Trust recipient to handle (don't hover or micromanage)  
    * Check back at deadline if follow-through needed (see step 6\)  
11. **Follow through (for urgent/complex items):**

    * At deadline or milestone: Check ticket status  
    * If not completed: Escalate to recipient's supervisor (not accusatory, problem-solving: "Ticket 12345 deadline today, checking status")  
    * Document follow-through check in ticket

**Procedure: Execute Hot Handoff (Urgent)**

1. **Prepare handoff template same as cold handoff** (documentation still required)

2. **Real-time communication FIRST:**

   * Call or instant message recipient directly  
   * "I need to hand off urgent item to you. Patient on hold / Deadline in 2 hours / Escalated issue. Can you take this now?"  
   * Verify recipient available and ready to proceed  
   * If recipient unavailable: Escalate to their supervisor or another team member immediately  
3. **Brief verbal context:**

   * Summarize key points from handoff template verbally (1-2 minutes)  
   * "Account 789, patient waiting for auth status, I just received approval from payer, you need to enter auth number 123456 and call patient back at \[number\] within next hour."  
   * Recipient restates understanding: "Got it, I'll enter auth 123456 for account 789 and call patient at \[number\] within the hour."  
4. **Send documentation simultaneously:**

   * While on call/chat, assign ticket and send handoff template  
   * "I'm assigning ticket 12345 to you now with full details."  
5. **Confirm start:**

   * "Can you start on this right now?" → Wait for confirmation  
   * If recipient cannot start immediately: Escalate further  
6. **Monitor completion:**

   * For hot handoffs, follow up within stated timeframe  
   * "Checking if you were able to call patient on ticket 12345?"  
   * Document outcome in ticket

**Procedure: Receive Handoff Professionally**

**When handoff assigned to you:**

1. **Review handoff documentation immediately** (for priority/urgent) or within 1 business day (for routine)

2. **Verify completeness:**

   * Do I have all information needed to proceed?  
   * Account identifier clear?  
   * Next steps actionable?  
   * Deadline understood?  
   * Context sufficient?  
3. **If incomplete, request clarification immediately:**

   * Reply in ticket: "Need additional info: \[specific question\]. Cannot proceed until clarified."  
   * Tag sender or escalate to supervisor if sender unresponsive  
   * DO NOT guess or assume missing information  
4. **If complete, acknowledge:**

   * For urgent: Acknowledge within 1 hour: "Received handoff, starting now"  
   * For priority: Acknowledge within 1 business day: "Handoff received, will complete by \[date\]"  
   * For routine: System assignment acknowledgment sufficient (start work per normal priority)  
5. **Execute task per handoff instructions:**

   * Follow next steps as documented  
   * Document actions taken in ticket as you progress  
6. **Close loop:**

   * When complete: Update ticket status "Completed," document outcome  
   * If applicable: Notify sender "Ticket 12345 complete, \[outcome summary\]"  
   * For complex handoffs: Brief outcome summary to sender appreciated

**Procedure: Handle Handoff Failures**

**If you discover handoff was incomplete or incorrect:**

1. **Document the gap:**

   * In ticket: "Handoff incomplete: \[specific missing information\]. Cannot proceed without \[X\]."  
   * Include what you tried: "Attempted to proceed with information provided, but encountered \[issue\]"  
2. **Request clarification from sender:**

   * Tag sender in ticket with specific question  
   * If urgent and sender unresponsive: Escalate to sender's supervisor  
3. **Escalate if pattern:**

   * If same sender provides consistently incomplete handoffs: Discuss with your supervisor  
   * Supervisor coaching needed for sender  
4. **Do NOT:**

   * Proceed with incomplete information and "hope for the best"  
   * Complain to colleagues without resolving  
   * Leave ticket abandoned without documentation

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if handoff information is incomplete — request clarification before proceeding  
* Stop if handoff has no deadline/priority — ask sender for timeframe  
* Stop if you're unsure you can complete handoff task — escalate to supervisor immediately (don't accept handoff beyond your capability)  
* Stop if handoff involves area outside your training — escalate (don't "learn on the fly" with patient-impacting work)

**Escalation Path:** Sender (for clarification) → Your supervisor (if you cannot execute) → Sender's supervisor (if sender unresponsive or pattern of poor handoffs)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Every handoff documented in ticket/case system with template elements  
* Handoff receipt acknowledgment (for priority/urgent)  
* Handoff outcome documented upon completion  
* Handoff failures/gaps documented with specific issues

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- Clean Cold Handoff:**

**Ticket 54321 assigned from Benefits Coordinator to Authorization Specialist:**

**HANDOFF DETAILS:**

**WHO:** Account 789456, Patient: \[Use MRN or account number only per minimum necessary\]  
 **WHAT:** Prior authorization submission for outpatient MRI lumbar spine  
 **WHEN:** Submit by 3/20/2024 (appointment scheduled 3/25)  
 **WHY:** Patient referred for MRI, payer requires prior auth. Called payer 3/15, confirmed auth required. Verified benefits, MRI covered, $200 patient responsibility. Obtained clinical notes from provider office 3/17. All documentation complete.  
 **CURRENT STATUS:** Ready to submit. All required documents attached to ticket (order, clinical notes, insurance card copy).  
 **NEXT STEPS:** Review documents for completeness, submit prior auth to payer via portal, track until approval/denial received, enter auth number into system when approved, notify patient of outcome and patient responsibility amount.  
 **DEPENDENCIES:** None, all documents complete.  
 **CONTACT:** \[Benefits Coordinator name\], ext 1234, \[email\]

**Why Compliant:** Complete template, all context provided, actions taken documented, current status clear, next steps specific and actionable, no gaps requiring recipient to ask questions, documented in ticket system.

**Authorization Specialist receives handoff:**

* Reviews ticket same day  
* Acknowledges: "Handoff received, will submit by 3/19"  
* Submits auth per instructions  
* Updates ticket with auth number when received  
* Notifies patient  
* Closes ticket with outcome documentation

**Outcome:** Clean execution, no delays, no rework, patient notified timely.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Hot Handoff:**

Patient on hold, needs urgent help with claim issue. Benefits Coordinator must leave for end of shift. Patient Claims Specialist available.

**Real-time handoff (phone call):** Benefits Coordinator: "I have patient on hold for urgent claim issue. Can you take this handoff now?" Patient Claims Specialist: "Yes, go ahead." Benefits Coordinator: "Account 456789, patient name \[verbally\], on hold at extension 5678\. Claim 123ABC denied code CO-50, patient received bill for $500. Patient is upset and asking if we can fix today. I pulled claim details, denial is for missing modifier, should be easy correction and resubmission. I'm assigning ticket 99999 to you with all details. Can you take the call now and handle?" Patient Claims Specialist: "Got it. Account 456789, claim 123ABC, denied for missing modifier, patient on hold ext 5678\. I'll take the call now and work the correction. I'll update ticket 99999 when resolved." Benefits Coordinator: "Perfect, thanks. Transferring call to you now."

**Documented handoff in ticket 99999:** \[Full template as in Example 1, with urgent flag and "Patient on hold" note\]

**Patient Claims Specialist:**

* Takes call immediately  
* Works correction  
* Resubmits claim  
* Updates patient  
* Documents outcome in ticket  
* Notifies Benefits Coordinator: "Resolved, claim resubmitted, patient satisfied"

**Why Compliant:** Hot handoff protocol followed (real-time communication FIRST), verification of recipient availability, brief verbal context with restatement, documentation still completed, immediate execution, loop closed with sender notification.

**Non-Compliant Example \- Dirty Handoff:**

**Ticket 11111 assigned from Order Entry to Benefits Verification:**

**Ticket note:** "Need auth. Please work."

**No additional information. Benefits Verification receives handoff:**

* What account? Not specified.  
* What service needs auth? Not specified.  
* What's the deadline? Not specified.  
* What actions already taken? Unknown.  
* What documentation exists? Unknown.  
* Who is the patient contact? Unknown.

**Benefits Verification attempts:**

* Spends 20 minutes searching for account based on ticket ID  
* Finds account, but multiple orders present \- which one needs auth?  
* Calls Order Entry person \- no answer  
* Sends email asking for clarification \- response delayed 24 hours  
* Meanwhile, patient calls asking about auth status \- Benefits Verification has no information  
* Finally gets clarification after 48 hours, submits auth  
* Auth delayed 2 days due to incomplete handoff, patient frustrated

**Why Non-Compliant:** Handoff violated every principle:

* No template used  
* No context provided  
* Ambiguous task description  
* No deadline  
* No contact information  
* Created rework, delay, patient dissatisfaction  
* Waste of Benefits Verification time trying to reconstruct context

**Result:** Coaching for Order Entry person on handoff protocol, escalated to supervisor, mandatory Module 3 refresher, pattern monitoring.

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Complete vs Incomplete Handoffs (10 Scenarios)**

Rate each handoff: COMPLETE (ready to execute) or INCOMPLETE (missing critical information)

1. "Account 123, need auth, please submit." → INCOMPLETE (no service type, no deadline, no context, no documents mentioned)

2. "Account 456, prior auth for PT eval, order attached, payer confirmed auth required 3/1, submit by 3/5, patient contact \[number\] if questions." → COMPLETE (service, context, deadline, document, contact)

3. "Claim denied, fix it." → INCOMPLETE (no claim number, no account, no denial reason, no context)

4. "Account 789, claim 456ABC denied CO-50 modifier missing, corrected modifier is 25, resubmit, deadline 3/10, prior notes in ticket." → COMPLETE (account, claim, issue, solution, deadline, context reference)

5. "Patient called, needs help with bill." → INCOMPLETE (no account, no specific issue, no patient contact, no actions taken)

6. "Account 321, patient called re: $200 bill for lab, claims processed, patient responsibility correct per benefits, explained to patient, patient still wants supervisor review, escalating to you, patient callback \[number\]." → COMPLETE (account, context, actions taken, current status, next step clear, contact)

7. "Urgent\! Handle ASAP." → INCOMPLETE (no context, no task, no account)

8. "Account 555, need payment posted." → INCOMPLETE (no payment amount, no payment source, no date, no documentation reference)

9. "Account 777, payment $300 received 3/15 check \#999, post to claim 789XY, payment EOB attached in system, post by 3/17." → COMPLETE (account, amount, source, date, claim, document, deadline)

10. "Someone needs to call this patient back." → INCOMPLETE (no account, no patient contact, no reason for callback, no context)

**Scoring:** 80% \= 8/10 correct

**Scenario Exercise: Draft Clean Handoff**

**Scenario:** You are Order Entry Specialist. You received order for MRI of right shoulder. You verified insurance, confirmed authorization required. You called payer, they need clinical notes before they can review auth. You requested notes from provider office 3/10, still waiting. Patient appointment scheduled 3/25. You need to hand off to Authorization team to follow up on notes and submit auth when received.

**Draft handoff using template:**

**Sample Compliant Handoff:**

**WHO:** Account 654321, \[Patient MRN\]  
 **WHAT:** Prior authorization for MRI right shoulder  
 **WHEN:** Appointment scheduled 3/25, submit auth by 3/22 to allow processing time  
 **WHY (Context):** Patient referred for MRI right shoulder by Dr. Smith. Insurance verified, payer requires prior auth. Called payer 3/10, confirmed auth required and clinical notes needed. Requested notes from Dr. Smith's office 3/10 (contact: \[office phone\]), office said will send by 3/15.  
 **CURRENT STATUS:** Waiting for clinical notes from provider office. Order and insurance card scanned and attached to ticket. All other documentation complete.  
 **NEXT STEPS:** Follow up with Dr. Smith's office on 3/15 to confirm notes sent. Once notes received, review for completeness, submit prior auth via payer portal. Track auth approval. Enter auth number when approved. Notify patient of outcome and any patient responsibility.  
 **DEPENDENCIES:** Clinical notes from provider office (pending)  
 **CONTACT:** \[Your name\], ext 2345, \[email\]. Provider office: \[number\].

**Why Compliant:** Complete template, full context, actions taken documented, dependencies clear, specific next steps, contact information provided.

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Recipient of handoff with questions  
 **Learner plays:** Sender executing handoff

**Trainer (as recipient):** "I received your handoff on ticket 5555\. The note says 'need auth for account 999.' I need more information \- what service, what's the deadline, what have you done so far?"

**Learner expected response:** "Let me complete the handoff properly. \[Opens template, provides\]:

* Account 999, patient \[MRN\]  
* Service: Physical therapy evaluation  
* Deadline: Submit by \[date\], patient has appointment \[date\]  
* Actions taken: Verified insurance 3/12

, confirmed auth required. Order and insurance card attached.

* Next steps: Review attached documents, submit auth via portal, track until approval  
* Contact: \[My name and extension\] if questions I'll update the ticket right now with complete details."

**Trainer:** "Better. What if I find the documents incomplete when I start?"

**Learner expected response:** "Tag me in the ticket with specifically what's missing. I'll get it and update. If it's urgent and I'm not responding quickly, escalate to my supervisor \[name\]. Don't let it sit \- let's resolve gaps immediately."

**Checklist: Handoff Execution**

* \[ \] Uses standardized template (WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHY, NEXT STEPS, CONTACT)  
* \[ \] Provides complete context (actions taken, current status, blockers)  
* \[ \] Documents handoff in system (not just verbal)  
* \[ \] Assigns to specific recipient or queue  
* \[ \] Sets appropriate priority/deadline flags  
* \[ \] For hot handoffs: communicates real-time FIRST, then documents  
* \[ \] Verifies recipient understanding (for urgent/complex)  
* \[ \] Follows through to confirm completion (for urgent/complex)  
* \[ \] Receives handoffs professionally (reviews promptly, acknowledges, requests clarification if needed)  
* \[ \] Closes loop when handoff complete (updates status, notifies sender if applicable)

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Handoff completeness assessment (10 scenarios): 3 points (8/10 \= 80%)  
* Clean handoff draft: 4 points (uses template, complete information, actionable next steps, contact provided)  
* Mini-simulation: 3 points (responds appropriately to incomplete handoff scenario, commits to improvement)  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (20 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Clean handoff requires: A) Just telling someone verbally  
 B) Structured template, complete context, documentation, verification  
 C) Email only  
 D) Supervisor approval

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Clean handoff \= structured format \+ complete information \+ documentation \+ verification.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Dirty handoff causes: A) Efficient workflow  
 B) Delays, rework, confusion, patient impact  
 C) Better communication  
 D) Time savings

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Incomplete handoffs create operational waste and patient impact.

**Item 3 (True/False):** "Need auth, please handle" is sufficient handoff documentation.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Missing critical information (account, service, deadline, context, documents, contact).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — not recognizing extreme incompleteness.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Hot handoff differs from cold handoff because: A) It's more important  
 B) It requires real-time communication first, then documentation  
 C) It doesn't need documentation  
 D) Only supervisors can do hot handoffs

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Hot handoff \= urgent, requires immediate real-time contact PLUS documentation.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** C — documentation still required for hot handoffs.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** You receive handoff: "Account 555, patient waiting on hold, handle now." What do you do first? A) Review full ticket details thoroughly before calling patient  
 B) Ask sender for verbal context immediately while taking call  
 C) Ignore since incomplete  
 D) Escalate to supervisor

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Patient waiting \= hot handoff, get brief verbal context and take call immediately; can review full details during/after call.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — patient waiting requires immediate action, not extended review.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Handoff template should include (select essential element): A) Sender's opinion of the task  
 B) Account identifier, task description, deadline, context, next steps, contact  
 C) Sender's personal schedule  
 D) Recipient's training history

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Template essential elements \= who/what/when/why/next/contact.

**Item 7 (True/False):** If handoff is incomplete, you should guess at the missing information and proceed rather than delay the work.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Request clarification immediately; guessing creates errors and risks.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — "just get it done" mentality sacrifices accuracy.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** When receiving handoff, you should: A) Start work without reviewing details  
 B) Review for completeness, request clarification if needed, acknowledge receipt  
 C) Assume sender provided everything needed  
 D) Forward to another team member

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Professional receipt \= review, clarify gaps, acknowledge.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Handoff says "Submit auth by 3/15" but doesn't specify which payer or provide insurance information. What do you do? A) Submit to any payer  
 B) Tag sender in ticket: "Need payer name and insurance details to proceed"  
 C) Close ticket as incomplete  
 D) Guess based on account history

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Request specific missing information immediately; cannot proceed without payer details.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Context transfer means: A) Moving files between folders  
 B) Sharing relevant background information recipient needs to continue work  
 C) Copying ticket to another system  
 D) Translating to another language

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Context transfer \= background info for seamless continuation.

**Item 11 (True/False):** Documentation of handoffs in system creates audit trail and prevents "he said/she said" confusion.

**Answer:** True  
 **Rationale:** System documentation provides accountability and clarity.

**Item 12 (MCQ):** Follow-through on handoff means: A) Micromanaging recipient  
 B) Checking completion at deadline, especially for urgent/complex items  
 C) Doing the work yourself  
 D) Ignoring after handoff

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Follow-through \= accountability check at deadline, not micromanagement.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — checking deadline is responsibility, not micromanagement.

**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** You consistently receive incomplete handoffs from same colleague. What do you do? A) Complain to other coworkers  
 B) Discuss with your supervisor for coaching of sender  
 C) Refuse all handoffs from that person  
 D) Complete handoffs despite gaps

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Pattern of poor handoffs requires supervisor intervention for coaching.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** D — accommodating poor handoffs enables pattern to continue.

**Item 14 (MCQ):** If you cannot execute handoff task (beyond your capability/training), you should: A) Try your best and hope it works  
 B) Escalate to your supervisor immediately  
 C) Research how to do it online  
 D) Hand off to someone else without checking

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Don't accept handoffs beyond capability; escalate immediately.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "trying your best" with patient-impacting work creates risk.

**Item 15 (True/False):** Verbal handoff without documentation is acceptable for urgent items since documentation takes time.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Even hot handoffs require documentation (real-time communication FIRST, then document).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — urgency doesn't eliminate documentation requirement.

**Item 16 (MCQ):** "Actions already taken" in handoff template prevents: A) Recipient from duplicating work already done  
 B) Supervisor review  
 C) Ticket closure  
 D) Patient contact

**Answer:** A  
 **Rationale:** Documenting prior actions prevents rework and provides context.

**Item 17 (Scenario MCQ):** Handoff includes next steps: "Call payer and ask about claim." This is: A) Sufficient direction  
 B) Insufficient \- needs claim number, specific question, payer contact, context  
 C) Too detailed  
 D) Perfect handoff

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Lacks specifics needed to execute (which claim, what question, which payer department, why calling).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** A — "call payer" seems like action but lacks executable detail.

**Item 18 (MCQ):** When closing loop on completed handoff, you should: A) Say nothing; completion is obvious  
 B) Update ticket status, document outcome, notify sender if applicable  
 C) Only update if sender asks  
 D) Wait for sender to check

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Close loop \= update system, document outcome, notify sender for accountability.

**Item 19 (Short Answer):** List the six essential elements of handoff template acronym WHO WHAT WHEN WHY NEXT CONTACT stands for.

**Answer:**

1. WHO: Account/patient identifier and recipient  
2. WHAT: Task description  
3. WHEN: Deadline/urgency  
4. WHY: Context (background, actions taken, current status)  
5. NEXT STEPS: What recipient should do  
6. CONTACT: Who to contact with questions

**Item 20 (MCQ):** Poor handoffs create patient impact by: A) Causing delays in care, billing errors, missed authorizations  
 B) Improving efficiency  
 C) Reducing documentation burden  
 D) Streamlining communication

**Answer:** A  
 **Rationale:** Incomplete handoffs directly impact patient experience and outcomes through delays and errors.

## **Course-Specific Application Notes**

### **COURSE 2 (ICD-10 for Non-Coders) \- Modules 1, 2, 4-6, 8-12**

**Critical boundary reinforcement:** Every module emphasizes non-coder scope (flag and route, never assign codes, draft neutral queries without code suggestions)

**Key procedures patterns:**

* Code structure analysis (identify but don't select)  
* Documentation gap identification  
* Provider query drafting (neutral language)  
* Denial root cause analysis (separate coding error from coverage limitation)  
* Escalation to coder (when specificity change needed)

**Common scenarios across modules:**

* Unspecified vs specific code analysis  
* Documentation supports more specific code → flag for coder  
* Provider query needed → draft without suggesting codes  
* Denial analysis → identify diagnosis-related vs other causes

### **COURSE 3 (Document Hygiene) \- Modules 1-4, 6-18**

**Critical controls reinforcement:** Clean screen/desk, storage location verification, redaction before sharing, channel discipline, no screenshots, timely updates

**Key procedures patterns:**

* Daily workspace setup verification  
* End-of-shift cleanup protocol  
* File storage location selection (check approved list)  
* Redaction tool usage  
* Screenshot alternatives (verbal description, screen share, test environment)  
* Update status in system before leaving work

**Common scenarios across modules:**

* Workspace interruption → secure immediately  
* Sharing needed → verify channel approved, redact PHI  
* Screenshot requested → refuse, offer alternatives  
* Storage uncertain → escalate before saving  
* Update overdue → complete before end of shift

### **COURSE 4 (Medical Scribe) \- Modules 1, 3-26**

**Critical scope reinforcement:** Documentation-only (no interpretation, no hallucinated facts, no clinical decisions)

**Key procedures patterns:**

* Listen to provider statement exactly  
* Transcribe in correct note section (SOAP or specialty format)  
* Prompt provider for clarification when unclear  
* Use 200-term job aid for terminology verification  
* Never add information provider didn't state  
* Specialty templates application (Modules 17-24 cover 8 specialties)

**Common scenarios across modules:**

* Provider's statement unclear → ask for clarification immediately  
* Terminology unfamiliar → ask provider to spell/define, use job aid  
* Documentation seems incomplete → prompt provider (don't fill gaps)  
* Specialty-specific format required → use approved template  
* Real-time documentation → type while listening, confirm accuracy

### **COURSE 5 (Executive Assistant) \- Modules 1-15**

**Critical controls reinforcement:** PHI-free calendars, minimum necessary triage, verification for executive requests, redacted distribution

**Key procedures patterns:**

* Calendar entry PHI check (remove patient names, use generic descriptions)  
* Inbox triage without over-reading (route by recipient, don't read unnecessary PHI)  
* Meeting preparation (redact notes before broad distribution)  
* Verification applies even to executives (no shortcuts for authority)  
* Attendee limitation (need-to-know principle for meeting invites)

**Common scenarios across modules:**

* Calendar entry includes patient name → sanitize before sending  
* Meeting notes contain PHI → redact before distribution to all attendees  
* Executive requests PHI urgently → verify executive has need-to-know, apply minimum necessary  
* Inbox contains PHI → route to owner without reading full content unless necessary for triage  
* Vendor meeting coordination → no PHI in external communications

### **COURSE 6 (Supporting Roles Bootcamp) \- Modules 1-2, 4-14**

**Common Core (Modules 1-8) for all roles:**

* Quality metrics understanding and tracking  
* Audit sampling and response procedures  
* Handoff protocols (Module 3 detailed above)  
* Escalation documentation standards  
* Professionalism under pressure  
* Conflict resolution techniques  
* Time management and priority setting  
* Continuous improvement behaviors

**Role-Specific Tracks (Modules 9-14+):**

* Module 9-14: Client Success Specialist (Medical Benefits) fully detailed in source  
  * Benefits investigations, pathway determination, cost estimates, financial assistance, worklist management, failure mode troubleshooting  
* Additional role tracks (Order Entry Specialist, Patient Claims Specialist, etc.) follow same structure:  
  * Role-specific workflows integrated with Courses 1-3 foundations  
  * Do-not-do boundaries from Course 1 reinforced  
  * Quality metrics specific to role  
  * Common failure modes for role  
  * Scenario library specific to role's daily tasks

---

## **PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE**

### **For Learning Management System (LMS) Configuration:**

**Course Prerequisites Enforcement:**

* Course 0 → Course 1 → {Course 2, 3} → {Course 4, 5, 6 as applicable by role}  
* Lock subsequent courses until prerequisites 100% complete  
* Course 1 role variants lock until core modules 1-12 complete

**Assessment Configuration:**

* Knowledge checks: 80% passing standard (except Module 5 screenshot prohibition \= 100%)  
* Unlimited attempts with cooling period after 3rd failure (24-48 hours, needs\_review per client)  
* Randomize question order and answer options where possible  
* Require sequential module completion (cannot skip ahead)

**Artifact Submission Workflow:**

* Designated submission points within each module  
* Supervisor review queue for artifacts requiring evaluation  
* Automated pass/fail for objective exercises (drill sets)  
* Rubric-based scoring for subjective exercises (written responses, documentation samples)

**Tracking and Reporting:**

* Individual learner dashboard showing course/module progress  
* Supervisor dashboard showing team completion rates and bottlenecks  
* Compliance dashboard showing org-wide completion by role and deadline  
* Refresher due date tracking with automated notifications (30 days advance)  
* Attempt counts and cooling period status visible to supervisors

### **For Supervisors Conducting Training:**

**Module Delivery Sequence:**

1. Assign module with entry-level day plan timeline  
2. Learner completes primer, definitions, procedures (reading)  
3. Learner reviews worked examples (video or text)  
4. Learner completes practice pack (hands-on exercises)  
5. Supervisor spot-checks practice pack submissions for quality  
6. Learner takes knowledge check (80% required to pass)  
7. If fail: review missed items, study relevant procedures, cooling period if 3+ failures  
8. If pass: module marked complete, next module unlocks

**Supervisor Review Priorities:**

* Practice pack artifacts (ensure quality, not just completion)  
* Knowledge check scores (identify struggling learners early)  
* Attempt patterns (multiple failures indicate need for intervention)  
* Real-work application (observe learned behaviors in actual work within 1 week of module completion)

**Coaching Interventions:**

* 2 failures: One-on-one review of missed concepts before 3rd attempt  
* 3 failures (cooling period triggered): Mandatory coaching session, learning plan, extended study time  
* Pattern across modules: Evaluate overall readiness for role, possible remediation plan or role reconsideration

### **For Learners:**

**Study Strategies:**

* Read procedures carefully; these become your job instructions  
* Practice drills until 90%+ accuracy before attempting knowledge check  
* Use worked examples to understand "why" behind procedures  
* Take notes during mini-simulations (you'll use these skills daily)  
* Ask supervisor for real-world examples if concepts unclear  
* Use job aids during actual work (they're designed for reference, not memorization)

**Time Management:**

* Course 0: 2-3 hours (complete before Course 1\)  
* Course 1: 6-16 hours depending on track (pace across 5 days per entry-level plan)  
* Course 2: 4-12 hours (pace across 6 days for Standard track)  
* Course 3: 8 hours (pace across 6 days)  
* Course 4: 20 hours (pace across 10 days)  
* Course 5: 10 hours (pace across 5 days)  
* Course 6: 16-24 hours (Common Core \+ role track)  
* **Total onboarding: 40-75 hours depending on role** (typically 2-3 weeks full-time equivalent)

**Success Indicators:**

* Pass knowledge checks first attempt (shows comprehension)  
* Practice pack scores 90%+ (shows mastery)  
* Real-work application within 1 week (shows retention)  
* No incidents related to trained topics in first 90 days (shows behavior change)  
* Positive feedback from team on handoffs, documentation, collaboration (shows integration)

## **CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE**

### **Annual Course Review Cycle:**

1. **Collect feedback** (learner surveys, supervisor observations, incident patterns)  
2. **Analyze metrics** (completion rates, failure patterns, time-to-competency, post-training incidents)  
3. **Update content** (regulatory changes, client policy changes, new scenarios from incidents)  
4. **Refresh needs\_review items** (verify client-specific elements still accurate)  
5. **Enhance weak modules** (modules with high failure rates or post-training incidents)  
6. **Maintain scenario library** (add new real incidents as teaching examples)

### **Refresher Training Triggers:**

1. **Annual calendar:** All courses refresh every 12 months (or shorter per client requirement)  
2. **Role change:** New role requires additional course completion  
3. **Policy change:** Affected modules refresh within 30 days of change  
4. **Incident/audit finding:** Individual completes targeted refresher on failed topic within 14 days

### **Quality Assurance Audits:**

* **Training record audits:** Quarterly verification of completion, attempts, cooling periods, scores  
* **Real-work audits:** Sample learner work product against module standards (documentation, handoffs, notes)  
* **Knowledge retention checks:** Spot quizzes 30/60/90 days post-training  
* **Incident correlation:** Track whether incidents correlate with training gaps

# **ADDITIONAL COMPLETE MODULE BUILDS (FINAL SET)**

## **COURSE 2: ICD-10 CODING OVERVIEW FOR OPERATIONS TEAMS**

### **MODULE 8: COMMON DENIAL DRIVERS RELATED TO DIAGNOSIS CODING (75 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Claim denials waste resources, delay payment, and frustrate patients. Many denials are diagnosis-related: unspecified codes (lacks detail payer needs), diagnosis-service mismatches (diagnosis doesn't support medical necessity for service), invalid codes (outdated/incorrect format), or coverage limitations (diagnosis not on payer's covered list). Your role is identifying denial root cause category (specificity issue vs mismatch vs invalid code vs coverage policy), then choosing correct resolution path: provider query for specificity, coder review for code accuracy, appeal preparation for coverage disputes. Understanding denial patterns prevents future denials and improves revenue cycle.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Reads denial reason codes and explanations accurately  
* Categorizes denials into root cause types (specificity, mismatch, invalid, coverage)  
* Chooses appropriate resolution path based on denial type  
* Distinguishes coding errors from coverage limitations (Source Scenario 19 pattern)  
* Escalates complex denials to authorization or appeals team  
* Documents denial analysis and resolution steps

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Denial:** Payer's refusal to pay claim, requiring correction or appeal for payment. Creates accounts receivable and patient billing issues.

**Denial Reason Code:** Standardized code explaining why claim was denied. Common formats: CO (Contractual Obligation), PR (Patient Responsibility), OA (Other Adjustment). Examples: CO-50 (payment adjusted because services not covered), CO-16 (claim lacks information needed for adjudication).

**Remark Code:** Additional explanation accompanying denial reason code, providing specific details. Example: "Diagnosis does not support medical necessity for this procedure."

**Denial Root Cause Categories:**

1. **Specificity Issue:** Unspecified diagnosis code used when specific code required for medical necessity determination  
2. **Diagnosis-Service Mismatch:** Diagnosis doesn't logically support need for service billed  
3. **Invalid Code:** Incorrect code format, outdated code, truncated code, non-existent code  
4. **Coverage Limitation:** Diagnosis not on payer's covered indications list per LCD/NCD, or frequency/quantity exceeded

**Resolution Paths (based on root cause):**

* **Specificity Issue → Provider Query:** Request provider clarify documentation to support more specific code, coder reviews and updates code, claim resubmitted  
* **Diagnosis-Service Mismatch → Coder Review:** Verify correct diagnosis submitted for service, may require provider query if documentation unclear, correct code and resubmit  
* **Invalid Code → Coder Review:** Correct code format/selection, resubmit with valid code  
* **Coverage Limitation → Appeal Preparation OR Patient Notification:** If service was medically necessary but not covered per policy, prepare appeal with supporting documentation OR notify patient of patient responsibility if appeal unlikely to succeed

**Appeal:** Formal request for payer to reconsider denial, includes supporting documentation (medical records, LCD/NCD references, medical necessity explanation). Requires authorization/appeals specialist involvement.

**Corrected Claim:** Claim resubmitted after correction (code updated, information added). Typically processed faster than appeals.

**Medical Necessity Denial:** Denial stating service not medically necessary for diagnosis submitted. Can be due to: (1) wrong diagnosis submitted (coding error), (2) insufficient documentation (provider query needed), or (3) payer coverage policy excludes diagnosis (coverage limitation, not coding error).

**Timely Filing:** Deadline for claim submission or appeal (typically 90-365 days from service date depending on payer). Missing timely filing \= automatic denial with no appeal possible.

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Analyze Denial and Determine Root Cause**

1. **Access denial information:**

   * Denial letter/EOB (Explanation of Benefits)  
   * OR denial code in claim processing system  
   * OR payer portal denial details  
2. **Identify denial reason code and remark codes:**

   * Primary reason code (e.g., CO-50, CO-16, CO-197)  
   * Remark codes providing additional detail  
   * Denial explanation text  
3. **Categorize denial using decision tree:**

    **Question 1: Does denial mention "unspecified," "non-specific," or "more specific diagnosis needed"?**

   * YES → **Specificity Issue**  
   * NO → Continue to Question 2  
4. **Question 2: Does denial mention "diagnosis does not support medical necessity" or "diagnosis-procedure mismatch"?**

   * YES → **Diagnosis-Service Mismatch** (possible coding error OR coverage limitation)  
   * NO → Continue to Question 3  
5. **Question 3: Does denial mention "invalid code," "incorrect code format," "code not valid for date of service"?**

   * YES → **Invalid Code**  
   * NO → Continue to Question 4  
6. **Question 4: Does denial reference LCD/NCD, "not a covered indication," "not on covered diagnosis list," or "frequency exceeded"?**

   * YES → **Coverage Limitation**  
   * NO → **Other Denial Type** (outside diagnosis-coding scope, escalate to claims team)  
7. **Review claim details:**

   * What diagnosis code(s) were submitted?  
   * What service/procedure was billed?  
   * What does provider documentation say about diagnosis and service need?  
   * Is there LCD/NCD for this service?  
8. **Determine if denial is coding-related or coverage-related:**

   * **Coding-related:** Wrong code used, code format incorrect, more specific code available that would support medical necessity  
   * **Coverage-related:** Correct code used per documentation, but payer policy doesn't cover diagnosis-service combination  
9. **Document analysis:**

   * Denial reason code: \[code\]  
   * Root cause category: \[specificity/mismatch/invalid/coverage\]  
   * Claim details: \[diagnosis codes, service codes\]  
   * Preliminary assessment: \[coding error vs coverage limitation\]  
   * Recommended resolution path: \[provider query/coder review/appeal/patient notification\]

**Procedure: Choose Resolution Path Based on Root Cause**

**For Specificity Issue Denials:**

1. Review provider documentation  
2. Determine if documentation contains specific details not captured in code:  
   * If yes (documentation supports more specific code): Route to coder for code update, prepare corrected claim  
   * If no (documentation truly lacks specifics): Draft provider query requesting clarification, wait for provider response, coder updates code, prepare corrected claim  
3. Timeline: Corrected claim resubmission typically 7-14 days  
4. Success rate: High if documentation supports specificity

**For Diagnosis-Service Mismatch Denials:**

1. Review if correct diagnosis was submitted:  
   * Compare diagnosis in documentation vs diagnosis on claim  
   * If mismatch found (wrong code submitted): Route to coder for correction, prepare corrected claim  
   * If diagnosis correct per documentation: Assess if this is coverage limitation (service not covered for this diagnosis per payer policy)  
2. If coverage limitation suspected:  
   * Check LCD/NCD (if available)  
   * If diagnosis not on covered list: Escalate to authorization/appeals for policy review and possible appeal with medical necessity justification  
   * If diagnosis on covered list: May be documentation insufficiency, route for provider query  
3. Timeline: Coding correction 7-14 days; appeal 30-60 days  
4. Success rate: Varies (coding errors → high; coverage limitations → low to moderate)

**For Invalid Code Denials:**

1. Verify code format and validity:  
   * Check ICD-10-CM current year guidelines  
   * Verify code exists and is valid for date of service  
   * Check for truncation (too few characters) or format errors  
2. Route to coder for correction  
3. Prepare corrected claim with valid code  
4. Timeline: 7-14 days  
5. Success rate: High (clerical errors easily corrected)

**For Coverage Limitation Denials (Source Scenario 19 Pattern):**

1. **Critical distinction:** This is NOT a coding error; correct code was used but payer policy doesn't cover  
2. Review payer's LCD/NCD or policy reference in denial  
3. Assess appeal likelihood:  
   * If medical necessity strong and documentation robust: Escalate to appeals team for appeal preparation  
   * If service was convenience/patient preference or documentation weak: Likely not successful appeal, prepare for patient notification  
4. Escalate to authorization/appeals specialist (do NOT attempt appeal independently)  
5. If appeal denied: Patient becomes financially responsible  
6. Timeline: Appeals 30-90 days  
7. Success rate: Moderate (depends on medical necessity strength and payer policy flexibility)

**Procedure: Document Denial Resolution**

1. **In denial tracking system or ticket:**

   * Denial reason code and category  
   * Root cause analysis  
   * Resolution path chosen  
   * Actions taken (provider query sent, corrected claim submitted, appeal initiated, patient notified)  
   * Timeline (target resolution date)  
   * Status updates as resolution progresses  
2. **Communication log:**

   * Provider queries sent and responses received  
   * Payer appeals submitted and outcomes  
   * Patient communications regarding responsibility  
3. **Outcome documentation:**

   * Resolution: Paid, partially paid, denied upheld, patient responsibility  
   * Payment amount recovered (if applicable)  
   * Lessons learned (for denial prevention)

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if denial analysis is unclear or outside your knowledge — escalate to supervisor or coding team  
* Stop if you're uncertain whether denial is coding error vs coverage limitation (Source Scenario 19 distinction is critical) — escalate to authorization specialist  
* Stop if appeal seems appropriate but you're not trained in appeal preparation — escalate to appeals team  
* Stop if timely filing deadline is approaching and resolution not clear — escalate urgently to prevent permanent denial

**Escalation Path:** Coder (for code corrections) → Authorization specialist (for coverage policy questions) → Appeals team (for appeal preparation) → Supervisor (for complex or unclear denials)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* All denials analyzed within 5 business days of receipt  
* Root cause category documented in denial tracking system  
* Resolution path documented with action steps and timeline  
* Outcome documented with payment recovered or patient responsibility confirmed

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- Specificity Issue Resolution:**

**Denial received:** Reason Code: CO-16 \- Claim lacks information needed  
 Remark: "Diagnosis code too vague. More specific diagnosis required for medical necessity determination."  
 Service: MRI lumbar spine  
 Diagnosis submitted: M54.5 (Low back pain)

**Employee analysis:**

* **Root cause:** Specificity Issue (denial states "too vague")  
* **Review documentation:** Provider note states "Low back pain with sciatica radiating to right leg"  
* **Assessment:** Documentation supports more specific code (M54.30 Sciatica OR M54.41 Lumbago with sciatica, right side)  
* **Resolution path:** Route to coder for code update based on documentation  
* **Action:** Escalate to coder with note: "MRI denial CO-16 for specificity. Provider documented sciatica right leg. Current code M54.5 (low back pain) is unspecified. More specific code available per documentation. Please review and update for corrected claim."

**Coder review:**

* Updates code to M54.41 (Lumbago with sciatica, right side)  
* Submits corrected claim

**Outcome:** Claim paid within 14 days. Denial resolved. Payment recovered.

**Why Compliant:** Correctly identified specificity issue, reviewed documentation, determined more specific code supported by documentation, routed to coder (stayed within non-coder boundary), documented analysis, achieved payment.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Coverage Limitation Recognition (Source Scenario 19):**

**Denial received:** Reason Code: CO-50 \- Payment adjusted, service not covered  
 Remark: "Diagnosis not included in LCD covered indications for this procedure"  
 Service: Knee replacement (TKR)  
 Diagnosis submitted: M25.561 (Pain in right knee)

**Employee analysis:**

* **Root cause:** Coverage Limitation (denial references LCD covered indications)  
* **Review LCD:** LCD for knee replacement lists covered diagnoses: severe osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, failed previous knee surgery. "Pain" alone not listed as covered indication.  
* **Review documentation:** Provider documented "right knee pain" as primary diagnosis. Documentation does not mention arthritis or structural damage.  
* **Assessment:** This is coverage limitation, NOT coding error. Code M25.561 (pain) accurately reflects provider's documentation, but payer policy doesn't cover knee replacement for pain alone without arthritis or structural damage.  
* **Resolution path:** Escalate to authorization/appeals specialist for review. Possible outcomes:  
  1. Provider query to see if arthritis or structural damage exists but wasn't documented (then code update and corrected claim)  
  2. Appeal with medical necessity argument (if imaging shows structural damage supporting replacement)  
  3. Patient responsibility if medical necessity doesn't align with payer policy  
* **Action:** Escalate with note: "TKR denial CO-50 coverage limitation. LCD requires arthritis or structural damage diagnosis. Current documentation/code shows pain only. Need review: (1) Is arthritis present but undocumented? (2) Does imaging support medical necessity? (3) Is appeal warranted?"

**Authorization specialist review:**

* Contacts provider: arthritis present on imaging, wasn't coded  
* Coder adds M17.11 (Unilateral primary osteoarthritis, right knee) as primary diagnosis  
* Submits corrected claim with arthritis code

**Outcome:** Claim paid with correct diagnosis. Issue was documentation/coding gap, but initial denial was coverage-based, not code error per se.

**Why Compliant:** Recognized denial as coverage limitation (not simple coding error), consulted LCD, understood Source Scenario 19 distinction (coding correct per documentation vs coverage policy criteria), escalated appropriately instead of attempting independent resolution, documented analysis clearly, achieved resolution through specialist involvement.

**Non-Compliant Example \- Misidentifying Coverage Limitation as Coding Error:**

**Denial received:** Reason Code: CO-50 \- Payment adjusted, service not covered  
 Remark: "Diagnosis does not support medical necessity"  
 Service: Sleep study (polysomnography)  
 Diagnosis submitted: R06.83 (Snoring)

**Employee (incorrect approach):** "This is a coding error. The diagnosis is wrong. I'll route to coder to change the code to obstructive sleep apnea G47.33, then we can resubmit."

**Why Non-Compliant:**

* Assumed coding error without reviewing provider documentation  
* Directed coder to use specific code (obstructive sleep apnea) without knowing if documentation supports that diagnosis  
* If provider only documented "snoring" (not sleep apnea), changing code to sleep apnea is incorrect coding (not supported by documentation)  
* This is likely coverage limitation: payer may not cover sleep study for snoring alone, requires documented sleep apnea symptoms or risk factors  
* Correct approach: Review documentation first. If provider documented only snoring, this is coverage limitation (service not covered for snoring diagnosis per payer policy). Resolution requires either: (1) provider query to determine if sleep apnea symptoms present but not documented, OR (2) patient notification of non-coverage. Cannot "fix" by changing code without documentation support.

**Result if non-compliant approach taken:** Incorrect code submitted (not supported by documentation), potential fraud/abuse allegation, claim denied again, possible audit, sanctions for inappropriate coding direction.

**Correct approach:** Review documentation. If only snoring documented, escalate: "Sleep study denial CO-50. Documentation shows snoring only. Payer may not cover sleep study for snoring without sleep apnea indicators. Need authorization specialist review: (1) Does documentation support sleep apnea diagnosis? (2) Is this coverage limitation? (3) Is appeal warranted or patient responsibility?"

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Denial Root Cause Classification (15 Scenarios)**

Classify each denial: (A) Specificity Issue, (B) Diagnosis-Service Mismatch, (C) Invalid Code, (D) Coverage Limitation, (E) Other (non-diagnosis-related)

1. Denial: "Diagnosis code E11.9 too unspecific for medical necessity review" → A (Specificity)

2. Denial: "Diabetes diagnosis does not support need for knee MRI" → B (Mismatch \- diagnosis doesn't match service body system)

3. Denial: "Code Z99.999 is not a valid ICD-10-CM code" → C (Invalid Code)

4. Denial: "Per LCD, migraine diagnosis not covered indication for this imaging" → D (Coverage Limitation)

5. Denial: "Claim filed past timely filing deadline" → E (Other \- administrative issue)

6. Denial: "More specific diagnosis required. Current code ends in .9 (unspecified)" → A (Specificity)

7. Denial: "Psychiatric diagnosis F41.9 does not support cardiac catheterization" → B (Mismatch \- wrong diagnosis for procedure)

8. Denial: "Code format incorrect \- missing 7th character for injury code" → C (Invalid Code)

9. Denial: "ICD-10 code required. ICD-9 code submitted." → C (Invalid Code \- outdated code set)

10. Denial: "Diagnosis M79.3 not on covered diagnosis list for this service per policy" → D (Coverage Limitation)

11. Denial: "Unspecified COPD code used. Specify acute exacerbation status." → A (Specificity)

12. Denial: "Diagnosis code truncated to 4 characters. 5-character code required." → C (Invalid Code format)

13. Denial: "Eye exam diagnosis (H52.4) does not support colonoscopy medical necessity" → B (Mismatch \- wrong body system)

14. Denial: "Frequency limit exceeded. Policy allows 1 per year for screening with this diagnosis." → D (Coverage Limitation \- frequency)

15. Denial: "Duplicate claim. Already processed." → E (Other \- duplicate)

**Scoring:** 80% \= 12/15 correct

**Scenario Exercise: Denial Analysis and Resolution Path**

**Scenario:**

**Denial Details:**

* Service: Physical therapy evaluation and treatment (10 sessions)  
* Diagnosis submitted: E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)  
* Denial Reason Code: CO-50 \- Payment adjusted, service not covered  
* Denial Remark: "Diagnosis does not support medical necessity for physical therapy services. Physical therapy requires musculoskeletal or neurological diagnosis."  
* Provider documentation: Patient has Type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy affecting gait and balance. PT ordered for gait training and fall prevention.

**Questions:**

1. What is the root cause category?  
2. Is this a coding error or coverage limitation?  
3. What is the correct resolution path?  
4. What specific actions should be taken?

**Sample Compliant Response:**

1. **Root cause category:** Diagnosis-Service Mismatch (diabetes diagnosis doesn't obviously support PT need; however, this is actually a coding gap rather than true mismatch)

2. **Coding error vs coverage limitation:** This appears to be **coding error/documentation gap**. Provider documented diabetic peripheral neuropathy (neurological complication) which DOES support PT medical necessity, but only the base diabetes code E11.9 (no complications) was submitted. The neuropathy complication was not coded.

3. **Resolution path:**

   * Route to coder with documentation review  
   * Coder should add E11.42 (Type 2 diabetes with diabetic polyneuropathy) based on provider documentation of "peripheral neuropathy"  
   * E11.42 is neurological diagnosis that supports PT medical necessity per payer's denial explanation  
   * Submit corrected claim with E11.42  
4. **Specific actions:**

   * Document analysis: "PT denial CO-50 diagnosis-service mismatch. Diabetes code E11.9 submitted. Provider documentation shows diabetic peripheral neuropathy affecting gait. Neurological complication code E11.42 supported by documentation but not submitted. Routing to coder for code update."  
   * Escalate to coder: "Please review documentation for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Update diagnosis code to E11.42 if supported. Prepare corrected claim."  
   * Expected outcome: Corrected claim with E11.42 submitted, likely to be paid as neurological diagnosis supports PT medical necessity

**Why Correct:** Analyzed denial thoroughly, reviewed documentation, recognized coding gap (neuropathy documented but not coded), distinguished this from pure coverage limitation, chose appropriate resolution path (coder review and corrected claim), documented clearly, stayed within non-coder boundary (flagged for coder, didn't assign code independently).

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Supervisor reviewing denial analysis  
 **Learner plays:** Employee explaining denial assessment

**Trainer:** "Walk me through this denial. Service was MRI brain. Diagnosis submitted was E11.9 diabetes. Denial says 'diagnosis doesn't support medical necessity.' What's your analysis?"

**Learner expected response:** "This appears to be diagnosis-service mismatch. Diabetes doesn't obviously support brain MRI medical necessity \- wrong body system. I reviewed the provider documentation. Provider documented diabetic neuropathy affecting vision \- that's a neurological complication that could support brain/neurological imaging. The issue is we only submitted E11.9 (diabetes without complications). We need the neuropathy code added. I'm routing this to the coder to review documentation and add the appropriate diabetic neurological complication code, probably E11.4x series. Then we can submit a corrected claim with the neurological diagnosis that supports the brain imaging."

**Trainer:** "What if the provider documentation doesn't mention any neurological symptoms, just diabetes?"

**Learner expected response:** "Then this would be a coverage limitation, not a coding error. The diabetes code would be correct per documentation, but payer policy doesn't support brain MRI for diabetes alone without neurological symptoms. Resolution would be different \- we'd need to escalate to authorization for possible provider query: 'Are there neurological symptoms that weren't documented but that led to the MRI order?' If truly no neurological symptoms, this might be patient responsibility or appeal would be needed with medical necessity justification. I'd escalate to authorization specialist for that review since it's a coverage policy question, not a simple coding correction."

**Trainer:** "Good. You understand the distinction between coding error and coverage limitation from Source Scenario 19\. That's critical."

**Checklist: Denial Analysis and Resolution**

* \[ \] Identifies denial reason code and remark codes accurately  
* \[ \] Categorizes denial into correct root cause type (specificity/mismatch/invalid/coverage/other)  
* \[ \] Reviews provider documentation before determining resolution  
* \[ \] Distinguishes coding errors from coverage limitations (Source Scenario 19\)

* Denial analysis scenario: 4 points (correct root cause, coding vs coverage distinction, appropriate resolution path, specific actions)  
* Mini-simulation: 2 points (demonstrates understanding of coding error vs coverage limitation)  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (20 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Denial reason code CO-50 typically indicates: A) Claim incomplete  
 B) Payment adjusted, service not covered  
 C) Timely filing exceeded  
 D) Duplicate claim

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** CO-50 is standard code for "service not covered" denials.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Specificity issue denials are best resolved by: A) Patient payment  
 B) Provider query to clarify documentation, then coder updates code  
 C) Appeal to payer  
 D) Submitting same claim again

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Specificity issues require more specific diagnosis code supported by documentation.

**Item 3 (True/False):** Denial stating "diagnosis does not support medical necessity" is always a coding error that can be fixed by changing the diagnosis code.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Could be coding error OR coverage limitation; must review documentation first (Source Scenario 19 distinction).  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — not recognizing coverage limitation possibility.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Source Scenario 19 teaches that denial due to "diagnosis not covered per LCD" indicates: A) Wrong code was submitted  
 B) Coverage policy limitation, not necessarily coding error  
 C) Coder made mistake  
 D) Provider documentation inadequate

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** LCD-based denials are coverage policy issues; code may be correct per documentation but policy doesn't cover.

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Denial: "Unspecified diabetes code E11.9 used. More specific code required." Documentation shows: "Type 2 diabetes with retinopathy." Resolution path: A) Appeal denial  
 B) Route to coder to update code to E11.3x (diabetes with retinopathy) based on documentation  
 C) Patient responsibility  
 D) Resubmit same claim

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Specificity issue with documentation supporting more specific code; route to coder for correction.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Invalid code denials (wrong format, outdated code) are resolved by: A) Appeal  
 B) Provider query  
 C) Coder correction and corrected claim resubmission  
 D) Patient payment

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Invalid codes are clerical errors corrected by coder.

**Item 7 (True/False):** If denial says "diagnosis not on covered diagnosis list per LCD," you should route to coder to change diagnosis code to one that is on the covered list.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Cannot change diagnosis code to match payer's covered list if documentation doesn't support different diagnosis; this would be incorrect coding/fraud.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — not understanding that codes must match documentation, not be selected for coverage.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** Your role in denial analysis is to: A) Determine root cause category and route to appropriate specialist  
 B) Independently appeal all denials  
 C) Change diagnosis codes to get claims paid  
 D) Tell patients they owe money

**Answer:** A  
 **Rationale:** Non-coder role: analyze and route appropriately, not independently resolve complex issues.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Denial: "Psychiatric diagnosis F41.9 does not support cardiac catheterization." Documentation: "Patient has anxiety disorder. Also has documented coronary artery disease." Diagnosis code submitted: F41.9 only. What happened? A) Coverage limitation  
 B) Coding error \- wrong primary diagnosis submitted; cardiac diagnosis (CAD) should have been submitted instead of/in addition to psychiatric diagnosis  
 C) Invalid code  
 D) Specificity issue

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Diagnosis-service mismatch due to coding error; psychiatric diagnosis submitted for cardiac procedure, but documentation shows cardiac diagnosis exists and should have been coded.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Coverage limitation denials should be escalated to: A) Patient immediately  
 B) Authorization/appeals specialist for review  
 C) Coder for code change  
 D) Provider for new order

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Coverage limitations require policy expertise and possible appeal; escalate to authorization/appeals specialist.

**Item 11 (True/False):** Corrected claims (after coding corrections) typically process faster than appeals.

**Answer:** True  
 **Rationale:** Corrected claims reprocess through normal adjudication (7-14 days); appeals require manual review (30-90 days).

**Item 12 (MCQ):** Timely filing deadline approaching with unresolved denial requires: A) Waiting for normal resolution timeline  
 B) Urgent escalation to prevent permanent denial  
 C) Patient notification immediately  
 D) Ignoring deadline

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Missing timely filing creates permanent denial; urgency required.

**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** Denial: "Code E11.999 is not a valid ICD-10-CM code." Root cause: A) Specificity issue  
 B) Coverage limitation  
 C) Invalid code (non-existent code)  
 D) Diagnosis-service mismatch

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Invalid code format/non-existent code number.

**Item 14 (MCQ):** When analyzing denial, you should review: A) Denial reason code only  
 B) Denial reason code, remark codes, claim details, provider documentation  
 C) Only the diagnosis code submitted  
 D) Only the payer's policy

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Complete analysis requires all elements: denial codes, claim details, documentation review.

**Item 15 (True/False):** All denials with diagnosis codes can be fixed by changing the diagnosis code.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Coverage limitation denials cannot be "fixed" by code changes if code is already correct per documentation.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — oversimplifying denial resolution.

**Item 16 (MCQ):** Medical necessity denial could be due to: (Select most complete answer) A) Wrong diagnosis code submitted  
 B) Insufficient documentation  
 C) Payer coverage policy excludes this diagnosis  
 D) All of the above

**Answer:** D  
 **Rationale:** Medical necessity denials can stem from coding error, documentation gaps, or coverage policy limitations.

**Item 17 (Scenario MCQ):** Documentation shows "low back pain." Denial: "Diagnosis too unspecific." You should: A) Change code to sciatica  
 B) Route to coder with note: "Denial for specificity. Documentation shows only 'low back pain' with no additional detail. Provider query may be needed if more specific diagnosis exists but not documented."  
 C) Appeal denial  
 D) Tell patient to pay

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Documentation truly lacks specifics; provider query needed before code can be more specific; escalate appropriately.

**Item 18 (MCQ):** Denial root cause categories help you: A) Determine correct resolution path  
 B) Assign diagnosis codes  
 C) Bill patients  
 D) Process payments

**Answer:** A  
 **Rationale:** Root cause categorization drives resolution path selection (query vs correction vs appeal).

**Item 19 (Short Answer):** What is the critical distinction taught by Source Scenario 19 regarding diagnosis-related denials?

**Answer:** Distinction between coding error (wrong code used, can be corrected) and coverage limitation (correct code used per documentation, but payer policy doesn't cover that diagnosis for the service). Coding errors are correctable; coverage limitations may require appeal or result in patient responsibility.

**Item 20 (MCQ):** Documentation shows diabetes with neuropathy. Code submitted: E11.9 (diabetes without complications). Denial: "Diagnosis doesn't support PT." This is: A) Coverage limitation \- diabetes not covered for PT  
 B) Coding gap \- neuropathy complication not coded; should add E11.42  
 C) Provider error  
 D) Invalid code

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Documentation supports complication code (E11.42 diabetic polyneuropathy) which wasn't coded; coding gap, not coverage limitation.

## **COURSE 3: DAY-TO-DAY DOCUMENT HYGIENE AND DATA HANDLING**

### **MODULE 12: DOWNLOAD CONTROLS (45 MIN)**

#### **1\) Entry-Level Primer**

**Plain Language Summary:** Downloads create uncontrolled PHI copies on local devices that persist outside system protections: difficult to secure, easy to accidentally share, remain after you no longer need them. Download controls prevent PHI proliferation: download only when explicitly required for job task (not convenience), download to approved location only (typically network drive, not local C: drive or personal devices), delete downloaded files immediately after use, never download to personal devices or removable media (USB drives, external hard drives, personal cloud). Understanding when downloads are necessary vs when you can work within the system prevents security breaches.

**Observable Behaviors:**

* Works within system rather than downloading when possible  
* Downloads only when job task explicitly requires it  
* Downloads to approved network location only  
* Deletes downloaded PHI files immediately after use (same day/shift)  
* Never downloads to personal devices, USB drives, or personal cloud storage  
* Escalates if unclear whether download is permitted

#### **2\) Definitions**

**Download:** Transferring file from system/server to local device storage (computer hard drive, laptop, phone, tablet). Creates file copy outside system controls.

**Approved Download Location:** Network drive or folder designated by client for temporary work file storage, with access controls and audit logging. Typically NOT local C: drive (individual computer hard drive). (needs\_review per client IT policy)

**Local Drive (C: Drive):** Individual computer's hard drive storage. Generally NOT approved for PHI downloads because: not centrally backed up, not centrally secured, difficult to audit access, remains on device if device lost/stolen/recycled.

**Personal Device:** Non-work device (personal laptop, tablet, phone, home computer). Absolutely prohibited for PHI downloads regardless of encryption or security measures. Includes personal cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive personal accounts).

**Removable Media:** USB flash drives, external hard drives, CDs/DVDs, SD cards. Generally prohibited for PHI due to loss risk and lack of encryption/controls. (needs\_review \- some clients allow encrypted removable media for specific approved purposes)

**Work-Within-System Principle:** Completing tasks using system's built-in functions (view, edit, print from system) without downloading files to local storage. Reduces PHI proliferation.

**Download Necessity Assessment:** Determining whether download is truly required for task or if task can be completed within system. Many tasks appear to "need" download but actually don't.

**Temporary Work File:** Downloaded file needed briefly for specific task (data analysis, reporting, merging files). Must be deleted immediately after task completion, not retained "in case needed later."

**Download Prohibition Scenarios:** Common situations where downloads seem necessary but are prohibited:

* "Working from home" without VPN/remote access (use VPN to access system, don't download files)  
* "Faster to download than work in slow system" (convenience is not valid reason)  
* "Backup copy in case system fails" (system has enterprise backup; personal backups prohibited)  
* "Need to work offline" (if offline work required, use approved encrypted device/method \- needs\_review)

#### **3\) Step-by-Step Procedures**

**Procedure: Assess Download Necessity**

**Before downloading ANY file containing or potentially containing PHI:**

1. **Question: Can I complete this task within the system without downloading?**

   * View reports in system browser without downloading?  
   * Edit notes/documentation directly in system?  
   * Print directly from system to network printer without downloading?  
   * Run analysis/reporting tools within system?  
   * If YES to any: Work within system. DO NOT download.  
   * If NO: Continue to step 2  
2. **Question: Is this download explicitly required by my job duties or approved workflow?**

   * Required: Generating month-end reports that must be downloaded to approved network location for executive review (per documented workflow)  
   * Required: Downloading data extract for approved analysis project per supervisor direction  
   * NOT required: Downloading for personal convenience ("faster on my computer")  
   * NOT required: Downloading "just in case I need it later"  
   * If YES (explicit requirement): Continue to step 3  
   * If NO: Work within system or escalate to supervisor if task seems impossible without download  
3. **Question: Is there an approved alternative that doesn't require download?**

   * Screen sharing for collaboration instead of file sharing?  
   * System's built-in reporting/export functions that generate reports without file download?  
   * Working during business hours with VPN access instead of offline?  
   * If alternative exists: Use alternative  
   * If no alternative: Continue to step 4  
4. **If download determined necessary, proceed with download controls procedure below**

**Procedure: Execute Approved Download**

**When download is necessary and authorized:**

1. **Verify download location approval:**

   * Confirm client's approved download location (needs\_review per client policy)  
   * Typically: Network drive folder (e.g., N:\\WorkFiles\[YourName\] or \\server\\downloads)  
   * NOT approved: C:\\Users\[YourName\]\\Downloads (local drive)  
   * NOT approved: Desktop, Documents, or any local folders  
   * NOT approved: Personal cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive personal)  
   * NOT approved: Personal devices, USB drives  
   * If uncertain: Ask IT or supervisor before downloading  
2. **Execute download to approved location:**

   * Select file in system  
   * Choose "Download" or "Export" or "Save As"  
   * Navigate to approved network location  
   * Use descriptive but PHI-free file name if possible: "Report\_March2024" not "PatientList\_March2024"  
   * Confirm file saved to correct approved location  
3. **Use file for intended purpose immediately:**

   * Complete task requiring downloaded file (analysis, reporting, review)  
   * Do NOT leave file idle for days/weeks  
4. **Delete file immediately after use (same day/shift):**

   * After task complete, permanently delete file from download location  
   * Empty recycle bin if applicable  
   * Do NOT retain "in case needed again" (re-download if needed in future, or work within system)  
5. **Document download if required by policy:**

   * Some high-security clients require download logging (file name, date, purpose, deletion date)  
   * Check if client requires download documentation (needs\_review)

**Procedure: Handle Prohibited Download Situations**

**If colleague, supervisor, or external party requests download to prohibited location:**

**Scenario A: "Download this report to your computer and email it to me."** Response: "Our policy prohibits downloading PHI to local computer drives. I can:

* Save the report to our approved network location and share access with you, OR  
* Print the report and scan to you via secure method, OR  
* Screen share to show you the report directly from the system Which works for you?"

**Scenario B: "I'm working from home this weekend, can you download these files to a USB drive for me?"** Response: "USB drives aren't approved for PHI downloads. Can you access the files remotely via VPN? If you don't have VPN access, we can request IT set that up. If this is urgent and VPN isn't available, we need to escalate to \[supervisor/IT security\] for approved solution."

**Scenario C: "Save this to your Dropbox so we can share it with the team."** Response: "Personal cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive personal) isn't approved for PHI. Our approved file sharing method is \[client's approved method \- SharePoint, secure network folder, etc.\]. Let me save it there and grant team access."

**If pressure continues after refusal:** Apply safe stop Rule 4, escalate to compliance.

**Procedure: Respond to Download Policy Violation Discovery**

**If you discover you violated download policy (downloaded to wrong location, forgot to delete, etc.):**

1. **Immediate containment:**

   * Locate the file  
   * Delete immediately from all locations (including recycle bin)  
   * If file was on personal device/removable media: permanently delete, factory reset device if device leaving your possession  
2. **Report as incident:**

   * Notify supervisor immediately: "I downloaded PHI file to \[wrong location\]. I've deleted it. Reporting as incident."  
   * Complete incident report per Module 10  
   * Document: what file, where downloaded, when discovered, deletion confirmation  
3. **If file was shared/transferred before discovery:**

   * Follow Module 10 incident response (attempt recovery, notify recipients to delete)  
   * Escalate as potential PHI disclosure  
4. **Cooperate with investigation:**

   * If IT conducts forensic check of device, cooperate fully  
   * Answer questions about file contents, how long it existed, who may have accessed

**Safe Stop Rules:**

* Stop if uncertain whether download is permitted — escalate to supervisor before downloading  
* Stop if download destination is not explicitly approved — confirm approved location before proceeding  
* Stop if asked to download to personal device or USB — refuse and offer alternatives  
* Stop if you realize you downloaded to wrong location — delete immediately and report as incident

**Escalation Path:** Supervisor (for download necessity questions) → IT Security (for approved location confirmation) → Compliance (if policy violation occurred or pressure to violate)

**Documentation Requirements:**

* Download logging if required by client (needs\_review)  
* Prohibited download incidents documented per Module 10  
* Download policy violations tracked as serious security incidents

#### **4\) Worked Examples**

**Compliant Example 1 \- Work-Within-System:** Employee needs to review patient account details to verify insurance coverage. Employee's first instinct: "I'll download the account list to Excel to sort and analyze."

Employee stops and assesses:

* Can I complete this within system? Check system's built-in search and filter functions.  
* System has search by insurance type and sort by account status.  
* Employee uses system filters, completes verification without downloading any files.

**Why Compliant:** Applied work-within-system principle, recognized download unnecessary, completed task using system functions, no PHI copies created outside system.

**Compliant Example 2 \- Approved Download with Immediate Deletion:** Supervisor assigns: "Generate monthly denial report. Download to network folder N:\\Reports\\Denials for executive review meeting tomorrow."

Employee actions:

1. Generates denial report in system (contains claim numbers, denial codes, amounts \- PHI present)  
2. Selects "Export to Excel"  
3. Navigates to N:\\Reports\\Denials (approved network location per client policy)  
4. Saves file: "Denial\_Report\_March2024.xlsx"  
5. Notifies supervisor: "Report saved to N:\\Reports\\Denials"  
6. After executive meeting next day, confirms with supervisor report no longer needed  
7. Deletes file from N:\\Reports\\Denials  
8. Empties recycle bin

**Why Compliant:** Download explicitly required by job duty (supervisor-assigned task), downloaded to approved network location, used descriptive PHI-free file name, deleted immediately after purpose complete (next day), confirmed deletion with supervisor.

**Non-Compliant Example 1 \- Personal Device Download:** Employee working from home, doesn't have VPN set up yet. Employee thinks: "I need to finish this authorization today. I'll just download the documents to my personal laptop, work on them at home, then upload back tomorrow."

Employee downloads files to personal laptop C:\\Users\[Name\]\\Documents.

**Why Non-Compliant:**

* Personal device download is absolute prohibition  
* Local drive download (C:) generally not approved even on work devices  
* Created uncontrolled PHI copy on personal device (no encryption verification, no access logging, device not company-managed)  
* "Need to work from home" does not override prohibition; correct solution is VPN setup or rescheduling work  
* Serious violation likely resulting in sanctions (written warning minimum, potentially termination depending on sensitivity and prior history)

**Correct response should have been:** "I don't have VPN access yet and I need to work from home. Can I get emergency VPN access today, or should I complete this tomorrow from the office? I cannot download to my personal device per policy."

**Non-Compliant Example 2 \- Download Retention:** Employee downloads patient billing data to approved network location for month-end analysis. Completes analysis on March 3\. Thinks: "I'll keep this file here in case I need it for next month's analysis."

File remains in network folder for 30 days until discovered during IT audit.

**Why Non-Compliant:**

* Downloaded file must be deleted immediately after use (same day/shift)  
* "In case needed later" is not valid retention reason  
* If needed again: re-download or preferably work within system  
* Creates unnecessary PHI proliferation and security exposure  
* Result: Coaching on immediate deletion requirement, documented policy violation, file deletion enforced

**Correct approach:** Delete file March 3 after completing analysis. If similar analysis needed next month: re-download new data OR use system reporting functions.

#### **5\) Practice Pack**

**Drill Set: Download Necessity Assessment (10 Scenarios)**

For each scenario, determine: (A) Work within system (no download needed), (B) Download approved (necessary for job duty), (C) Download prohibited (convenience not necessity), (D) Escalate (unclear)

1. Need to review patient account. System has account viewing function. → A (Work within system)

2. Supervisor assigned: "Download data extract to N:\\Projects for analysis project." → B (Download approved \- explicit job duty)

3. "System is slow today. I'll download everything to my computer to work faster." → C (Download prohibited \- convenience)

4. Need to print report. System has print function. → A (Work within system \- print from system)

5. Working from home without VPN. Want to download files to work offline. → C (Download prohibited \- use VPN or work in office)

6. "Let me download this to my USB drive as backup in case system crashes." → C (Download prohibited \- system has enterprise backup)

7. Need to create Excel analysis per approved workflow documented by supervisor. → B (Download approved if workflow requires; otherwise D \- escalate to confirm)

8. Colleague asks: "Can you download this report and email it to me?" → D (Escalate \- verify colleague's need, explore alternatives like system access or screen share)

9. "I want to save this on my phone so I can review tonight." → C (Download prohibited \- personal device)

10. Report generation requires downloading to approved network folder per documented procedure. → B (Download approved \- documented workflow requirement)

**Scoring:** 80% \= 8/10 correct

**Scenario Exercise: Refuse Prohibited Download Request**

**Scenario:** Your supervisor urgently requests: "I'm traveling and don't have my laptop. Can you download the patient census report and email it to my personal Gmail? I need to review tonight."

**Draft your response (exact words you would say/write):**

**Sample Compliant Response:**

"I understand this is urgent. However, our policy prohibits downloading to local devices and sending to personal email accounts due to PHI security. Here are some approved alternatives:

1. You can access the report remotely via VPN if you have VPN credentials on a personal device (needs IT policy confirmation)  
2. I can schedule a screen share call where I show you the report from the system without downloading  
3. If you can access the office network remotely, I can save the report to your network folder (N:\\YourName) where you can access it securely  
4. If this is truly urgent and none of the above work, we should escalate to \[IT Security/Compliance\] to determine an approved emergency access method

Which option works best, or should I escalate for emergency access approval?"

**Why Compliant:**

* Clearly refuses prohibited action (download to local \+ personal email)  
* Explains policy reason (PHI security)  
* Offers multiple approved alternatives  
* Acknowledges urgency while maintaining policy  
* Escalation option if no alternatives viable  
* Professional and helpful tone while refusing

**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Colleague requesting download help  
 **Learner plays:** Employee applying download controls

**Round 1:** **Trainer:** "Can you download these patient files to a USB drive for me? I need to work on them at a different office location tomorrow."

**Learner expected response:** "USB drives aren't approved for PHI downloads per our policy. Can you access the files remotely from the other office location via VPN? Or I can save them to your network folder that you can access from any office. Or if you need them on a device, we should check with IT about approved encrypted device options. Let's find an approved solution."

**Round 2:** **Trainer:** "This is really urgent and I don't have time for alternatives. Just do it this once."

**Learner expected response:** "I understand the urgency, but I cannot download PHI to USB drives regardless of urgency \- it's a security policy I have to follow. Let me help you with an approved solution right now. Can you access VPN from the other office? That's the fastest way. If not, I'll escalate to my supervisor and IT Security immediately to get you emergency approved access. But I cannot use USB drives."

\[If trainer continues pressure, learner escalates to supervisor/compliance per safe stop Rule 4\]

**Checklist: Download Controls**

* \[ \] Assesses download necessity before every download (work-within-system first)  
* \[ \] Downloads only when explicitly required for job duty  
* \[ \] Downloads to approved network location only (never local C: drive, personal devices, USB drives)  
* \[ \] Uses PHI-free file names when possible  
* \[ \] Deletes downloaded files immediately after use (same day/shift)  
* \[ \] Never downloads to personal devices or personal cloud storage  
* \[ \] Refuses prohibited download requests professionally  
* \[ \] Offers approved alternatives when download requested  
* \[ \] Escalates if download necessity unclear  
* \[ \] Reports download policy violations as incidents

**Scoring Rubric:**

* Download necessity assessment (10 scenarios): 3 points (8/10 \= 80%)  
* Prohibited download refusal script: 4 points (clear refusal, alternatives offered, professional tone, escalation option)  
* Mini-simulation: 3 points (maintains policy under pressure, offers alternatives, escalates if needed)  
* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \= 80% passing)**

#### **6\) Knowledge Check (15 Items)**

**Item 1 (MCQ):** Downloads create uncontrolled PHI copies that are: A) Easier to secure than system data  
 B) Difficult to secure, easy to accidentally share, persist outside system protections  
 C) Automatically encrypted  
 D) Preferred for security

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Downloads create security risks due to lack of centralized controls.

**Item 2 (MCQ):** Work-within-system principle means: A) Never leave the office  
 B) Complete tasks using system functions without downloading files when possible  
 C) Always download for backup  
 D) Work only during business hours

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Work-within-system \= use system's built-in functions instead of downloading.

**Item 3 (True/False):** Downloading to personal laptop is acceptable if you encrypt the files.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Personal device downloads prohibited regardless of encryption.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — believing encryption makes personal devices acceptable.

**Item 4 (MCQ):** Approved download location is typically: A) C:\\Users\\Downloads (local drive)  
 B) Personal Dropbox  
 C) Network drive designated by client (e.g., N:\\WorkFiles)  
 D) USB flash drive

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Network drives have centralized controls and audit logging (needs\_review per client).

**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** You need to review patient list. System has list viewing function. You should: A) Download list to Excel for easier sorting  
 B) Use system's viewing and filtering functions without downloading  
 C) Download to C: drive temporarily  
 D) Email list to yourself

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Task can be completed within system; download unnecessary.

**Item 6 (MCQ):** Downloaded PHI files should be deleted: A) After one year  
 B) Never, keep for records  
 C) Immediately after use, same day/shift  
 D) When you remember

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Immediate deletion required after task complete; don't retain "just in case."

**Item 7 (True/False):** "System is slow so I'll download to work faster" is valid reason for download.

**Answer:** False  
 **Rationale:** Convenience is not valid download justification; system slowness doesn't override security controls.  
 **Common Wrong Answer:** True — prioritizing convenience over security.

**Item 8 (MCQ):** If supervisor requests you download PHI to USB drive for them, you should: A) Comply since supervisor requested  
 B) Refuse and offer approved alternatives (VPN access, network folder)  
 C) Download but encrypt the drive  
 D) Download to your USB then give to supervisor

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** USB downloads prohibited even when supervisor requests; offer approved alternatives.

**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Working from home without VPN. Want to finish authorization. You should: A) Download files to personal laptop to work offline  
 B) Request VPN access or complete work from office next day  
 C) Download to USB and work on home computer  
 D) Email files to personal Gmail to access at home

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** No personal

device or removable media downloads; VPN is proper solution or reschedule work.

**Item 10 (MCQ):** Retaining downloaded files "in case needed later" is: A) Good practice for efficiency  
 B) Prohibited; delete immediately after use, re-download if needed again  
 C) Required for audit trail  
 D) Acceptable if files encrypted

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Immediate deletion required; retention "just in case" creates unnecessary PHI proliferation.

**Item 11 (True/False):** If you accidentally download to wrong location (e.g., C: drive instead of network drive), you should delete immediately and report as incident.

**Answer:** True  
 **Rationale:** Immediate containment (delete) and incident reporting required for policy violations.

**Item 12 (MCQ):** Personal cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox personal, OneDrive personal) for PHI is: A) Acceptable if you use strong password  
 B) Acceptable for encrypted files only  
 C) Absolutely prohibited  
 D) Acceptable for non-sensitive PHI

**Answer:** C  
 **Rationale:** Personal cloud storage prohibited for all PHI regardless of sensitivity or security measures.

**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** Supervisor assigns: "Generate monthly report and save to N:\\Reports\\Monthly for executive meeting." After meeting, supervisor says "thanks, we're done with that report." You should: A) Leave report in N:\\Reports\\Monthly for next month  
 B) Delete report from N:\\Reports\\Monthly immediately  
 C) Move to your personal folder for reference  
 D) Email to supervisor for their records

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Delete immediately after purpose complete per supervisor confirmation.

**Item 14 (MCQ):** Before downloading any file, you should: A) Check with supervisor every time  
 B) Assess if task can be completed within system without downloading  
 C) Always download for backup  
 D) Use USB for speed

**Answer:** B  
 **Rationale:** Download necessity assessment first step; work-within-system when possible.

**Item 15 (Short Answer):** List three reasons why downloads create security risks compared to working within the system.

**Answer:** (Any three of: difficult to secure centrally, easy to accidentally share, persist after no longer needed, remain on device if device lost/stolen, lack audit logging of access, may be copied to multiple locations, difficult to delete permanently, outside system access controls, can be transferred to removable media/personal devices)

#### **7\) QA and Audit Hooks**
