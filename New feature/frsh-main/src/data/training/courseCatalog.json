                "Common failure modes (re-listed)\n\n* Minimum necessary over-application: Learners withhold information needed for care coordination out of excessive caution. Coach to distinguish operational need from curiosity.\n* Verification script abandonment: Learners skip verification steps when patient seems frustrated or time-pressured. Emphasize that verification protects patient, not staff convenience.\n* Password complexity shortcuts: Learners create passwords meeting letter of policy but easy to guess. Provide password manager education and passphrases guidance.\n* Phishing false negatives: Learners trust sophisticated phishing emails with correct logos and formatting. Focus on sender verification and link inspection, not appearance.\n* Incident under-reporting: Learners fail to report near-misses or minor incidents out of fear of consequences. Reinforce reporting culture and non-punitive investigation approach for honest mistakes.\n* Documentation incompleteness: Learners document actions but omit critical details like timestamps, verification results, escalation decisions. Provide templates that prompt for required fields.\n* Role-variant confusion: Learners apply controls from wrong role variant. Ensure clear labeling and role-appropriate scenario selection.\n\nCoaching tips (re-listed)\n\n* Use real incidents from healthcare (anonymized) to illustrate consequences. Abstract scenarios lack emotional impact.\n* Pair minimum necessary teaching with examples of under-disclosure causing care delays. Balance needed.\n* During phone verification practice, increase difficulty progressively. Start with cooperative patient, advance to impersonator attempts.\n* For remote workstation security, review learner workspace photos individually. Public group review creates defensiveness. Private review enables honest conversation.\n* Phishing simulation: don't penalize first failure. Treat as learning moment. Require re-take after coaching.\n* Incident response simulation: use timer to create urgency. Escalation decisions under time pressure reveal knowledge gaps.\n* For role variants, assign scenarios in learner's actual role first, then expose to other roles' scenarios to build empathy for cross-functional challenges.\n\nRemediation plan (re-listed)\n\n* Learners failing module quizzes (below 80%) after second attempt: Schedule 1:1 coaching session with trainer. Review missed items. Identify knowledge gaps vs misunderstanding vs reading errors. Provide additional scenario practice targeting gap areas. Require third attempt after minimum 24-hour gap for processing.\n* Learners failing final exam (below 85%) on first attempt: Review item analysis to identify weak domains. Assign targeted re-study of specific modules. Require learner to submit notes on weak domains before second attempt. If second attempt fails, escalate to operations manager and HR for performance plan.\n* Learners failing practical evaluation: Break skills into smaller components. Coach each component to mastery before re-attempting full evaluation. Use remedial scenarios with decreasing complexity until baseline competency achieved.\n* Persistent failures across multiple assessments: Investigate root cause - language barriers, technical access issues, role mismatch, confidence issues. May require role reassignment or additional prerequisite training (e.g., medical terminology if healthcare knowledge gap, English language support if communication issue).\n\n---\n\n## 5) FINAL COVERAGE AUDIT (PART 1 SCOPE ONLY)\n\n### 5.1 Topic Inventory (extracted list, PART 1 scope)\n\nProgram-level standards\n\n* Delivery modes: Self-Paced Track; Instructor-Led Track; Blended Track\n* Minimum passing standards: Pre-test baseline only; module quizzes 80% with unlimited attempts and 24-hour cooling after third failure; final exam 85% with two attempts and third requiring manager approval + remediation plan; practical evaluation binary pass/fail per task with repeat until competency\n* Required training records fields (13 fields listed)\n* Refresher cadence logic: Annual Baseline (11-month notification); Role Change (5 business days); Policy Change (10 business days, flagged modules by policy mapping); Incident-Triggered (3 business days after closure, scope by type/root cause); Client-Specific (3 business days, core not repeated unless exceeds baseline)\n* Enforcement sanctions process language: First (verbal coaching + 3 business day extension + documented); Second (written warning + PIP + possible system suspension); Third (final written warning + escalation + suspension from client-facing work); Fourth (termination or non-renewal); acceleration clause; applies regardless of role/tenure\n* Definitions: PHI; ePHI; Minimum Necessary; Incident; Breach; breach determination by client privacy officer\n\nRole map and assignment rules\n\n* Role map fields: Role; Pod/Function; Core Tasks; Systems Touched; PHI Exposure Level; Evidence (for 8 roles)\n* Role-based training matrix rows for 8 roles including required courses, modules rule, refresher cadence strings\n* Enrollment rule summary triggers: hire; role change; policy change; incident; client assignment; quarterly clinical documentation audit (scribe)\n\nCourse 1 elements\n\n* Audience statement\n* Duration options: Essentials 6 hours foundation only no role variants; Standard 10 hours; Intensive 16 hours including all scenarios + live simulations + policy writing workshop\n* Prerequisites: none\n* Learning outcomes 1 to 15 (verbatim)\n* Modules 1 to 16: titles, times, objectives, key topics, activity/lab, knowledge check\n* Scenario library 1 to 20 (titles and required response intents preserved)\n* Job aids and SOP pack 1 to 12\n* Assessment blueprint: pre-test domains/items; module quizzes per module; final exam structure/domains/pass/attempts/time; practical evaluation rubric items and thresholds\n* Trainer guide notes: common failure modes; coaching tips; remediation plan items\n\n### 5.2 Coverage Ledger (Topic Inventory item -> exact location in new structure, PART 1 scope)\n\nProgram-level standards\n\n* Delivery modes -> Section 1.3\n* Passing standards -> Section 1.4; reinforced in Course 1 Assessment Package\n* Training records fields -> Section 1.5; referenced in C1-CAP evidence and assessment records\n* Refresher cadence logic -> Section 1.6; enrollment summary Section 2.3\n* Sanctions process language -> Section 1.7; Course 1 module C1-M12 lessons; Course 1 assessments include sanctions acknowledgment field reference in records\n* Definitions -> Section 1.8; applied throughout Course 1 modules C1-M01, C1-M03, C1-M10, C1-M11\n\nRole map and assignment rules\n\n* Role map table -> Section 2.1\n* Training matrix -> Section 2.2\n* Enrollment rule summary per role -> Section 2.3\n\nCourse 1\n\n* Audience/durations/prereqs/outcomes -> Section 3.1.0\n* Module 1 content -> C1-M01-L01 to C1-M01-L03\n* Module 2 content -> C1-M02-L01 to C1-M02-L03\n* Module 3 content -> C1-M03-L01 to C1-M03-L04\n* Module 4 content -> C1-M04-L01 to C1-M04-L02\n* Module 5 content -> C1-M05-L01 to C1-M05-L04\n* Module 6 content -> C1-M06-L01 to C1-M06-L03\n* Module 7 content -> C1-M07-L01 to C1-M07-L03\n* Module 8 content -> C1-M08-L01 to C1-M08-L03\n* Module 9 content -> C1-M09-L01 to C1-M09-L03\n* Module 10 content -> C1-M10-L01 to C1-M10-L04\n* Module 11 content -> C1-M11-L01 to C1-M11-L03\n* Module 12 content -> C1-M12-L01 to C1-M12-L02\n* Role variant Revenue Cycle -> C1-M13-L01 to C1-M13-L04\n* Role variant Clinical Support -> C1-M14-L01 to C1-M14-L04\n* Role variant Front Office -> C1-M15-L01 to C1-M15-L04\n* Role variant Executive Support -> C1-M16-L01 to C1-M16-L03\n* Intensive policy writing workshop -> C1-CAP\n* Scenario library 1-20 -> Section 3.1.2 (each scenario mapped to modules/lessons)\n* Job aids 1-12 -> Section 3.1.3 (each job aid mapped to lessons)\n* Assessment blueprint -> Section 3.1.4\n* Trainer guide failure modes/coaching/remediation -> Section 3.1.5\n* Remediation routing -> Section 3.1.4 table (mapped to lesson IDs)\n\n### 5.3 Confirmation line (PART 1 scope)\n\nCoverage complete: 0 unmapped items.\n## PART 2 of 4\n"

Explain how ICD-10 supports claims and documentation workflows\n  2. Identify the difference between ICD-10-CM diagnosis coding and CPT/HCPCS procedure coding (high level)\n  3. Recognize key ICD-10-CM structure elements: categories, subcategories, extensions, laterality, encounter types\n  4. Use safe lookup and verification workflows inside client-approved tools without inventing diagnoses\n  5. Detect common documentation gaps that block accurate coding and route clarification correctly\n  6. Avoid high-risk behavior: “coding by guessing,” upcoding, and altering clinical meaning\n  7. Interpret medical necessity signals in documentation at a non-coder level\n  8. Understand denials that relate to diagnosis coding mismatch, specificity, or documentation insufficiency\n\n#### 4.1.1 Modular Architecture\n\n**Course ID**: C6\n**Lesson ID format**: C6-M##-L##\n\n---\n\n##### Module 1 (C6-M01) Scope, Ethics, and Compliance Boundaries (60 min)\n\n* Key topics: what non-coders can and cannot do; integrity; never invent; never change provider intent; escalation and audit trail\n* Activity: 25-scenario boundary classification\n* Knowledge check: 15-item quiz\n* Lessons\n\n  * **C6-M01-L01 (20 min)** Coding vs documentation support: role boundaries"
