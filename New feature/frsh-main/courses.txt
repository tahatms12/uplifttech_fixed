PART 1 of 4

## 1) PROGRAM OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Program name

UPLIFT TECHNOLOGIES HEALTHCARE COMPLIANCE TRAINING PROGRAM

### 1.2 Intended audience and roles

* Client Success Specialist (Medical Benefits)
* Clinical Nurse Coordinator
* Order Entry Specialist (OES)
* Patient Claims Specialist (PCS)
* Patient Accounts Receivable Specialist
* Executive Assistant
* Medical Scribe (MBBS)
* Accounts Receivable Executive (Patient Balance Collections)

### 1.3 Delivery modes

* Self-Paced Track: Asynchronous modules with embedded activities, quizzes, and scenario simulations. Learner controls pacing within completion deadline windows.
* Instructor-Led Track: Virtual classroom sessions delivered synchronously with live scenario practice, Q&A, and group troubleshooting. Requires scheduled attendance.
* Blended Track: Combination of self-paced foundation modules followed by instructor-led capstone and practical evaluation.

### 1.4 Passing standards

* Pre-test: No minimum score required. Used for baseline assessment and learning path customization.
* Module quizzes: 80% minimum to advance to next module. Unlimited attempts with 24-hour cooling period after third failure.
* Final exam: 85% minimum. Two attempts permitted. Third attempt requires manager approval and remediation plan.
* Practical evaluation: Must demonstrate competency on all critical tasks in rubric. Binary pass/fail per task. Failed tasks must be repeated until competency achieved.

### 1.5 Training records fields

Store these fields in HR/LMS for each completed training:

* Employee ID and full name
* Role at time of training
* Course title and version number
* Completion date and time (UTC and local)
* Pre-test score
* Module quiz scores (each module separately)
* Final exam score and attempt number
* Practical evaluation results with evaluator name
* Instructor name (if instructor-led track)
* Training delivery mode
* Next refresher due date
* Acknowledgment of sanctions policy (boolean flag with timestamp)
* Training certificate issued (boolean flag with certificate ID)

### 1.6 Refresher cadence logic

* Annual Baseline: All roles complete full refresher every 12 months from last completion date. System generates notification at 11 months.
* Role Change: Employee moving to new role completes training for new role within 5 business days of role change effective date. Previous role training remains on record but new baseline starts.
* Policy Change: When client policy changes affect workflows documented in training, impacted modules must be completed within 10 business days of policy effective date. System flags modules by policy mapping.
* Incident-Triggered: Employee involved in privacy incident, security incident, or quality failure completes remediation training within 3 business days of incident closure. Remediation scope determined by incident type and root cause.
* Client-Specific: When employee assigned to new client account, completes client-specific addendum within 3 business days. Core training not repeated unless client requirements exceed baseline.

### 1.7 Sanctions process language

Failure to complete required training by deadline or failure to maintain passing standards results in progressive response:

* First Occurrence: Verbal coaching with training coordinator. Extended deadline granted (3 business days). Incident documented in employee file.
* Second Occurrence: Written warning. Manager develops performance improvement plan including supervised training completion. Access to production systems may be suspended until training complete.
* Third Occurrence: Final written warning. Escalation to operations leadership. Immediate suspension from client-facing work until training complete and competency demonstrated.
* Fourth Occurrence: Termination or contract non-renewal per employment agreement.
  Sanctions apply regardless of role or tenure. Uplift reserves right to accelerate sanctions process for high-severity training failures involving PHI exposure or compliance violations.

### 1.8 Definitions

* PHI (Protected Health Information): Any information about a patient that can identify them, combined with information about their health, treatment, or payment. Examples: name with diagnosis, medical record number with procedure, phone number with appointment reason, insurance ID with claim detail.
* ePHI (Electronic Protected Health Information): PHI in electronic form. Includes data in EHRs, emails, billing systems, spreadsheets, screenshots, databases, and any digital format.
* Minimum Necessary: Use and disclose only the smallest amount of PHI needed to complete the specific task. Default to less information rather than more. When in doubt, ask supervisor for scope guidance.
* Incident: Any use, access, or disclosure of PHI that violates policy or creates risk, regardless of whether harm occurred. Includes wrong-person errors, unauthorized access, lost devices, phishing clicks, policy violations, and near-misses.
* Breach: An incident involving unsecured PHI that poses significant risk of harm to patients. Not all incidents are breaches. Breach determination made by client privacy officer, not by Uplift staff.

#### 3.1.5 Trainer Guide (Operational) (Course 1)

Common failure modes (re-listed)

* Minimum necessary over-application: Learners withhold information needed for care coordination out of excessive caution. Coach to distinguish operational need from curiosity.
* Verification script abandonment: Learners skip verification steps when patient seems frustrated or time-pressured. Emphasize that verification protects patient, not staff convenience.
* Password complexity shortcuts: Learners create passwords meeting letter of policy but easy to guess. Provide password manager education and passphrases guidance.
* Phishing false negatives: Learners trust sophisticated phishing emails with correct logos and formatting. Focus on sender verification and link inspection, not appearance.
* Incident under-reporting: Learners fail to report near-misses or minor incidents out of fear of consequences. Reinforce reporting culture and non-punitive investigation approach for honest mistakes.
* Documentation incompleteness: Learners document actions but omit critical details like timestamps, verification results, escalation decisions. Provide templates that prompt for required fields.
* Role-variant confusion: Learners apply controls from wrong role variant. Ensure clear labeling and role-appropriate scenario selection.

Coaching tips (re-listed)

* Use real incidents from healthcare (anonymized) to illustrate consequences. Abstract scenarios lack emotional impact.
* Pair minimum necessary teaching with examples of under-disclosure causing care delays. Balance needed.
* During phone verification practice, increase difficulty progressively. Start with cooperative patient, advance to impersonator attempts.
* For remote workstation security, review learner workspace photos individually. Public group review creates defensiveness. Private review enables honest conversation.
* Phishing simulation: don't penalize first failure. Treat as learning moment. Require re-take after coaching.
* Incident response simulation: use timer to create urgency. Escalation decisions under time pressure reveal knowledge gaps.
* For role variants, assign scenarios in learner's actual role first, then expose to other roles' scenarios to build empathy for cross-functional challenges.

Remediation plan (re-listed)

* Learners failing module quizzes (below 80%) after second attempt: Schedule 1:1 coaching session with trainer. Review missed items. Identify knowledge gaps vs misunderstanding vs reading errors. Provide additional scenario practice targeting gap areas. Require third attempt after minimum 24-hour gap for processing.
* Learners failing final exam (below 85%) on first attempt: Review item analysis to identify weak domains. Assign targeted re-study of specific modules. Require learner to submit notes on weak domains before second attempt. If second attempt fails, escalate to operations manager and HR for performance plan.
* Learners failing practical evaluation: Break skills into smaller components. Coach each component to mastery before re-attempting full evaluation. Use remedial scenarios with decreasing complexity until baseline competency achieved.
* Persistent failures across multiple assessments: Investigate root cause - language barriers, technical access issues, role mismatch, confidence issues. May require role reassignment or additional prerequisite training (e.g., medical terminology if healthcare knowledge gap, English language support if communication issue).

* **Audience**

  * Non-coder support roles who touch documentation, claims support, prior auth support, and RCM workflows
  * Patient Coordinator, Client Success Specialist, Order Entry, Claims Support, Insurance Support, EA, Scribes (overview only)
* **Prerequisites**

  * Course 1 (HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Response)
  * Course 3 (Day-to-Day Document Hygiene and Data Handling)
* **Purpose**

  * Build operational literacy in ICD-10-CM concepts so teams can read charts, support clean documentation, and reduce avoidable rework, without practicing medical coding beyond scope.
* **Learning outcomes**

  1. Explain how ICD-10 supports claims and documentation workflows
  2. Identify the difference between ICD-10-CM diagnosis coding and CPT/HCPCS procedure coding (high level)
  3. Recognize key ICD-10-CM structure elements: categories, subcategories, extensions, laterality, encounter types
  4. Use safe lookup and verification workflows inside client-approved tools without inventing diagnoses
  5. Detect common documentation gaps that block accurate coding and route clarification correctly
  6. Avoid high-risk behavior: “coding by guessing,” upcoding, and altering clinical meaning
  7. Interpret medical necessity signals in documentation at a non-coder level
  8. Understand denials that relate to diagnosis coding mismatch, specificity, or documentation insufficiency
