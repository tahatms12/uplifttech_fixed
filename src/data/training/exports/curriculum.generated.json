A) Mix of online and in-person  \n B) Mix of self-paced and instructor-led  \n C) Optional attendance at live sessions  \n D) Choose your own schedule\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Blended combines self-paced modules with scheduled instructor sessions.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — \"online vs in-person\" is not the distinguishing feature; both components can be online.\n\n**Item 3 (True/False):** You can switch from Standard to Essentials track if Standard seems too long.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Duration track is assigned based on role requirements; changing without approval creates training gaps.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — belief that tracks are learner preference rather than requirement.\n\n**Item 4 (MCQ):** Course 1 Intensive track includes which component not in Standard? A) Role variant modules  \n B) Live simulations  \n C) Final exam  \n D) Core modules 1-12\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Intensive adds live simulations and policy writing workshop.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — role variants are in all tracks.\n\n**Item 5 (Ordering):** Arrange course sequence correctly: A) Course 1 → Course 0 → Course 3  \n B) Course 0 → Course 3 → Course 1  \n C) Course 0 → Course 1 → Course 3  \n D) Course 3 → Course 0 → Course 1\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Source mandates Course 0 first, Course 1 second, Course 3 after Course 1\\.\n\n**Item 6 (Scenario MCQ):** You are assigned Course 2 Standard (8 hours).

Receive training completion notification from learning management system  \n3. Access your training record in system within 24 hours of completion  \n4. Verify all required fields populated:  \n   * Your name and employee ID correct  \n   * Course name and number correct  \n   * Completion date accurate  \n   * Delivery mode documented  \n   * Duration track documented  \n   * All assessment scores recorded  \n   * Attempt counts recorded (if multiple attempts occurred)  \n   * Cooling periods documented (if applicable)  \n   * Supervisor signature/approval present (electronic or manual)  \n   * Refresher due date calculated and displayed  \n5. If any field is missing or incorrect: report to training coordinator within 48 hours  \n6. Print or save PDF copy of completed training record for personal records (optional but recommended)  \n7. Note refresher due date in personal calendar with 30-day advance reminder\n\n**Procedure: Track and Complete Refresher Training**\n\n1. Identify applicable refresher triggers for your role:  \n   * Annual trigger: 12 months from course completion date (or shorter per client needs\\_review)  \n   * Role change trigger: assignment to new responsibilities requiring additional training  \n   * Policy change trigger: notification from compliance team of significant policy update  \n   * Incident/audit trigger: notification from supervisor of required retraining  \n2. When trigger occurs, verify refresher course assignment in learning management system  \n3. If refresher not automatically assigned within 30 days of trigger: escalate to training coordinator  \n4. Complete refresher training within assigned timeframe (typically 30 days for annual; 14 days for policy change; immediate for incident)  \n5. Refresher completion generates new training record; verify fields as above  \n6. New refresher due date calculated from refresher completion date\n\n**Safe Stop Rules:**\n\n* Stop if training record fields are incomplete — incomplete records fail audits  \n* Stop if refresher due date is missing — cannot track compliance without date  \n* Stop if refresher assignment is not received within expected timeframe — escalate immediately\n\n**Escalation Path:** Training coordinator → Compliance lead → Client account manager (if client-specific issue)\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* All training record fields completed per list above  \n* Refresher completion documented separately from initial training (separate record)  \n* Escalations regarding missing records or assignments documented in ticket system",

A) No consequence; signature is optional  \n B) Audit finding; incomplete record  \n C) You must retake the course  \n D) Supervisor is disciplined, not you\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Incomplete training records create audit findings; learner is responsible for verifying within 24-48 hours of completion.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — signature is required field, not optional.\n\n**Item 6 (MCQ):** When should you verify your training record is complete? A) During the next audit  \n B) Within 24 hours of completion  \n C) When refresher is due  \n D) Only if requested by supervisor\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Procedure requires verification within 24 hours (48 hours maximum) of completion.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — waiting until audit is too late to correct.\n\n**Item 7 (MCQ):** Incident/audit finding trigger requires retraining: A) Annually  \n B) Quarterly  \n C) Immediately  \n D) Within 30 days\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Incident/audit triggers require immediate targeted retraining.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — 30 days applies to annual refresher, not incident trigger.\n\n**Item 8 (True/False):** Refresher training completion generates a new training record separate from the initial training record.\n\n**Answer:** True  \n **Rationale:** Source states refresher completion creates separate record; initial record remains for audit trail.\n\n**Item 9 (MCQ):** You are assigned to a new role requiring Course 2 (you have not taken Course 2 before). This is an example of which trigger? A) Annual trigger  \n B) Role change trigger  \n C) Policy change trigger  \n D) Incident trigger\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Role change trigger includes new responsibilities requiring additional training.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — annual trigger applies to courses already completed.\n\n**Item 10 (Ordering):** Arrange these steps for refresher completion: A) Complete refresher → Verify new record → Set new calendar reminder → Identify trigger  \n B) Identify trigger → Complete refresher → Verify new record → Set new calendar reminder  \n C) Verify new record → Identify trigger → Complete refresher → Set new calendar reminder  \n D) Identify trigger → Set new calendar reminder → Complete refresher → Verify new record\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Logical sequence is trigger recognition → completion → verification → tracking.\n\n**Item 11 (Short Answer):** Name the four universal refresher triggers.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. Annual calendar  \n2. Role change  \n3. Policy change  \n4. Incident/audit finding\n\n**Rationale:** Source lists these four plus client-specific as triggers.\n\n**Item 12 (Scenario MCQ):** Your refresher is due March 1\\. You receive the assignment February 15 with 30-day completion window. You are very busy. You complete it March 31\\. What is the issue? A) No issue; completed within 30 days  \n B) Missed due date; should complete by March 1  \n C) Should request extension first  \n D) Supervisor should grant automatic extension\n\n**Answer:** A  \n **Rationale:** 30-day completion window means 30 days from assignment (Feb 15), so deadline is March 17; March 31 is late. However, if \"due date\" means original trigger date (March 1\\) and 30-day window starts from due date, then March 31 is within window. This is ambiguous; assuming 30-day window from assignment (Feb 15), March 31 is late.\n\n**Corrected Answer: Scenario is ambiguous as written. If 30-day window starts from assignment date (Feb 15), deadline is March 17 and March 31 is late. If 30-day window starts from due date (March 1), deadline is March 31 and completion is on time. Best practice: complete before original due date (March 1\\) when possible.**\n\nFor testing purposes:  \n **Revised Item 12 (Scenario MCQ):**  \n Your refresher is due March 1\\. You receive the assignment February 15 with instruction to \"complete by due date.\" You complete it March 5\\. What is the issue? A) No issue if completed within 30 days of assignment  \n B) Missed due date of March 1  \n C) No due date applies to refreshers  \n D) Due date is flexible\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Instruction states \"complete by due date\" (March 1); March 5 is late.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — 30-day window does not override explicit \"by due date\" instruction.",

High-severity failures involving PHI exposure or compliance violations can accelerate directly to termination regardless of prior history (acceleration clause). Understanding sanctions motivates compliance and prevents career-ending mistakes.\n\n**Observable Behaviors:**\n\n* Meets all training deadlines  \n* Maintains passing standards on all assessments  \n* Reports incidents and near-misses immediately  \n* Cooperates with investigations  \n* Does not retaliate against reporters  \n* Understands which behaviors trigger which sanction levels",

No formal discipline on employment record but documented in training/compliance file.\n\n**Second Occurrence \\- Written Warning:** Formal written warning placed in employment file. Includes performance improvement plan with specific corrective actions and monitoring period (typically 30-60 days).\n\n**Third Occurrence \\- Final Warning:** Final written warning stating that any additional occurrence may result in termination. Monitoring period extended (typically 60-90 days). May include temporary restrictions on duties or access.\n\n**Fourth Occurrence \\- Termination:** Employment termination. Applies after exhausting three prior levels OR immediately under acceleration clause.\n\n**Acceleration Clause:** High-severity failures involving PHI exposure, compliance violations, fraud, or intentional policy circumvention can skip directly to termination regardless of prior discipline history. Examples: creating fake training records, accessing patient records without authorization, sharing credentials, bypassing cooling periods through fraud, deleting evidence during investigations.\n\n**Retaliation Prohibition:** Policy forbidding punishment, negative treatment, or discrimination against employees who report incidents, near-misses, policy violations, or compliance concerns. Retaliation itself triggers sanctions up to termination.\n\n**Occurrence:** Single instance of training failure or compliance violation within a rolling 12-month window.

              "contentMarkdown": "**Procedure: Understand How Sanctions Apply**\n\n1. Review categories of sanctionable conduct:  \n   * Training failures: missed deadlines, failed all attempts without completion, non-participation in required training  \n   * Assessment integrity violations: cheating, having someone else take assessment, sharing answers  \n   * Operational compliance failures: policy violations, incidents caused by negligence, repeat errors after training  \n   * High-severity violations: PHI breaches, fraud, credential sharing, evidence tampering  \n2. When any occurrence happens, expect supervisor notification within 5 business days  \n3. Supervisor meeting will review:  \n   * What happened (facts)  \n   * Which policy/requirement was violated  \n   * Sanction level applied based on occurrence count and severity  \n   * Corrective actions required  \n   * Timeline for completion  \n   * Consequences of additional occurrences  \n4. Sign acknowledgment of sanction (signature confirms receipt, not agreement)  \n5. Complete corrective actions within specified timeline  \n6. Document completion and submit to supervisor  \n7. If occurrence qualifies for acceleration clause: expect immediate termination discussion; HR will be present\n\n**Procedure: Report Without Fear of Retaliation**\n\n1. Identify reportable concern (incident, near-miss, policy violation, unsafe practice)  \n2. Report immediately through proper channel:  \n   * Supervisor (first line)  \n   * Compliance hotline (if supervisor is involved or unresponsive)  \n   * HR (if retaliation concern exists)  \n3. Provide factual description without speculation  \n4. If you experience negative treatment after reporting:  \n   * Document specific instances (dates, actions, witnesses)  \n   * Report retaliation to HR immediately  \n   * Retaliation investigation will be conducted separately  \n5. Continue performing job duties professionally during any investigation\n\n**Safe Stop Rules:**\n\n* Stop if asked to falsify training records — report immediately; participation triggers termination  \n* Stop if pressured to skip training or assessments — escalate to compliance  \n* Stop if threatened for reporting concerns — document and escalate to HR\n\n**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → HR → Compliance lead → Legal (for retaliation or high-severity violations)\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* All sanctions documented in employee file with occurrence date, level, corrective actions, and completion status  \n* Retaliation complaints investigated and documented separately  \n* Acceleration clause invocations require written justification from compliance lead",

Third occurrence of incomplete documentation → Final Warning  \n5. Sharing password with colleague to meet deadline → Termination (acceleration clause)  \n6. Fourth occurrence of late status updates → Termination (progressive)  \n7. Deleting incident evidence after being told to preserve → Termination (acceleration clause)  \n8. First occurrence of verification script abandonment → Counseling  \n9. Creating fake training completion certificate → Termination (acceleration clause)  \n10. Second occurrence of using unapproved communication channel → Written Warning\n\n**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** You receive written warning (second occurrence) for missing Course 2 deadline. Three weeks later, you accidentally send PHI to wrong recipient via approved channel, immediately report incident, preserve evidence, and cooperate fully with investigation. Investigation finds no negligence; was honest mistake. What sanction level applies?\n\n**Answer:**  \n Depends on investigation findings. If truly accidental with proper immediate response and no negligence pattern, may receive counseling or written warning (third occurrence) rather than termination. However, if PHI exposure was due to not following trained procedures (e.g., skipping recipient verification from Module 7), could be treated as higher severity with potential for final warning (third occurrence) or acceleration consideration if exposure was significant. Immediate reporting and evidence preservation are mitigating factors.\n\n**Best Answer:** Third occurrence \\= Final Warning, given immediate reporting and cooperation. Acceleration unlikely if procedures were followed and error was truly inadvertent.\n\n**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Supervisor conducting sanctions meeting  \n **Learner plays:** Employee receiving written warning (second occurrence)\n\n**Trainer:** \"This is your second occurrence in six months.

A) Missing training deadline  \n B) Failing assessment twice  \n C) Sharing your password with colleague  \n D) Requesting deadline extension\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Credential sharing is high-severity compliance violation triggering acceleration.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** B — failing assessments is progressive, not acceleration (unless fraud involved).\n\n**Item 5 (MCQ):** Retaliation prohibition protects employees who: A) Fail training repeatedly  \n B) Report incidents and compliance concerns  \n C) Violate policies  \n D) Miss deadlines\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Retaliation prohibition protects reporters of incidents, near-misses, and compliance concerns.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — policy violations are not protected conduct.\n\n**Item 6 (Scenario MCQ):** You received counseling 14 months ago for late documentation. Today you miss a training deadline. What sanction level applies? A) Counseling (first occurrence)  \n B) Written warning (second occurrence)  \n C) Final warning  \n D) Termination\n\n**Answer:** A  \n **Rationale:** 12-month rolling window means 14-month-old occurrence no longer counts; today's is first occurrence.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** B — not understanding rolling window resets occurrence count.\n\n**Item 7 (MCQ):** During sanctions meeting, you should: A) Argue why the sanction is unfair  \n B) Listen, ask clarifying questions, sign acknowledgment  \n C) Refuse to sign until you consult a lawyer  \n D) Demand to speak to HR immediately\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Professional response is to listen, clarify, acknowledge receipt (signature is not agreement with sanction).  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — signature confirms receipt, not agreement; refusal does not prevent sanction.\n\n**Item 8 (True/False):** If you report an incident, your supervisor can give you a poor performance review as punishment.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Retaliation prohibition forbids negative treatment for reporting.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — not understanding retaliation protection scope.\n\n**Item 9 (MCQ):** Third occurrence in the progressive framework results in: A) Counseling  \n B) Written warning  \n C) Final warning  \n D) Termination\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Progressive sequence is counseling → written warning → final warning → termination.\n\n**Item 10 (MCQ):** Which action does NOT trigger acceleration clause? A) Deleting incident emails  \n B) Accessing records without authorization  \n C) Failing refresher training after three attempts  \n D) Creating fake training certificates\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Failing assessments is progressive discipline; others are fraud/high-severity.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** B — unauthorized access triggers acceleration.\n\n**Item 11 (Short Answer):** You witness a colleague bypassing verification steps under pressure. What are your two immediate actions?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. Report to supervisor immediately  \n2. Do not confront colleague directly; allow investigation process\n\n**Rationale:** Immediate reporting is required; direct confrontation may compromise investigation or create conflict.\n\n**Item 12 (Scenario MCQ):** You receive final warning (third occurrence). One month later, you have a minor incident (sent email with wrong subject line format, immediately corrected). What is the likely consequence? A) Verbal reminder, no formal sanction  \n B) Additional counseling  \n C) Termination (fourth occurrence)  \n D) Final warning extended\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Fourth occurrence after final warning typically results in termination per progressive framework.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — final warning status means any additional occurrence may result in termination; severity is evaluated but fourth occurrence is termination unless investigation finds no policy violation.",

              "contentMarkdown": "**PHI (Protected Health Information):** Information (oral, written, or electronic) that:\n\n1. Identifies or can identify an individual (contains direct or indirect identifiers such as name, MRN, account number, contact info, dates tied to care, etc.), AND  \n2. Relates to individual's health condition, healthcare provision, or healthcare payment\n\n**Examples of PHI:**\n\n* Patient name \\+ diagnosis  \n* Account number \\+ appointment reason  \n* Photo containing patient \\+ clinic location  \n* Email address \\+ claim number  \n* Voicemail containing patient name \\+ test results\n\n**Direct Identifiers:** Name, MRN, SSN, account number, phone number, email, address, photo, biometrics, IP address, device IDs.\n\n**Indirect Identifiers:** Age (if rare), dates (birth, admission, discharge, death if tied to care), geographic subdivisions smaller than state (if population \\< 20,000).\n\n**ePHI (Electronic Protected Health Information):** PHI in electronic form, including information created, stored, transmitted, or received electronically. Includes data in computer systems, emails, text messages, portal messages, scanned documents, digital photos, databases, electronic health records.\n\n**Distinction from paper PHI:** ePHI requires specific technical safeguards (encryption, access controls, audit logs) in addition to physical safeguards. Handling procedures may differ (e.g., secure deletion vs shredding).\n\n**Minimum Necessary Standard:** Requirement to use, disclose, and request only the minimum amount of PHI reasonably needed to accomplish the intended purpose. Applies to:\n\n* Documentation (include only necessary identifiers and details)  \n* Communication (share only what recipient needs for their role)  \n* Access requests (request only necessary permissions)\n\n**Does NOT apply to:**\n\n* Treatment activities (providers may access all relevant PHI for treatment)  \n* Disclosures to patient themselves or their authorized representative  \n* Disclosures required by law\n\n**Incident:** Any use, access, or disclosure of PHI that violates policy or creates risk, including near-misses (events that could have resulted in violation but were caught/stopped in time). Examples:\n\n* Wrong recipient email (sent or caught before sending)  \n* Unauthorized access to records  \n* Lost/stolen device with PHI  \n* Verification failure followed by disclosure  \n* Workstation left unlocked in presence of unauthorized person  \n* Unapproved channel usage\n\n**Key principle:** Incidents include near-misses; do not wait for harm to occur before reporting.\n\n**Breach:** An incident involving the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of unsecured PHI that poses a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual, as determined by the client's privacy officer (not by staff member). Requires specific notification procedures including patient notification, regulatory reporting, and potential public disclosure depending on scope.\n\n**Key principle:** Staff report incidents; privacy officer determines if incident rises to breach level. Staff never self-determine breach status.\n\n**Unsecured PHI:** PHI not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized persons through encryption or destruction per federal standards. (Needs\\_review for specific client encryption requirements and safe harbor standards.)",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Procedure: Identify PHI in Mixed Content**\n\n1. Examine content (document, email, screen, conversation)  \n2. Scan for identifiers:  \n   * Names (patient, guarantor, family member if linked to patient)  \n   * Numbers (MRN, account, claim, SSN, phone, insurance ID)  \n   * Contact info (email, address)  \n   * Dates tied to care or payment (appointment, admission, DOB, etc.)  \n   * Photos or other identifying media  \n3. Scan for health or payment context:  \n   * Diagnosis, symptoms, treatment  \n   * Medications, test results, procedures  \n   * Claim status, payment, billing  \n   * Insurance coverage, benefits  \n4. If BOTH identifier AND health/payment context present: treat as PHI  \n5. If identifier only (no health/payment context): still sensitive but may not be PHI (e.g., patient name in directory without medical context)  \n6. If health/payment context only (no identifier): may be sensitive but not PHI (e.g., \"patient with diabetes\" in training without any identifiers)  \n7. When uncertain: treat as PHI and escalate for confirmation\n\n**Procedure: Apply Minimum Necessary Standard**\n\n1. Identify purpose of use, disclosure, or access  \n2. Ask: \"What is the minimum information needed to accomplish this specific purpose?\"  \n3. Remove or redact:  \n   * Unnecessary identifiers (e.g., if account number suffices, remove name)  \n   * Unnecessary clinical details (e.g., if verifying eligibility, omit diagnosis)  \n   * Unnecessary dates or contacts  \n4. Document using generic terms where possible (e.g., \"pt\" instead of full name in operational notes)  \n5. When communicating, confirm recipient's need-to-know before sharing  \n6. If unable to determine minimum necessary: escalate to supervisor with proposed scope\n\n**Procedure: Recognize and Report Incidents**\n\n1. Observe or become aware of potential policy violation or risk event  \n2. Ask: \"Did this involve PHI? Was policy followed correctly? Was there risk of unauthorized access/disclosure?\"  \n3. If yes to any question: treat as incident  \n4. Include near-misses: \"Almost sent to wrong recipient\" is reportable incident  \n5. Report immediately using incident reporting procedure (Module 10\\)  \n6. Do NOT self-assess whether incident is a breach  \n7. Cooperate with investigation  \n8. If you caused the incident: report anyway (self-reporting is protected and expected)\n\n**Safe Stop Rules:**\n\n* Stop if uncertain whether content contains PHI — treat as PHI until confirmed otherwise  \n* Stop if uncertain about Minimum Necessary scope — escalate before disclosing  \n* Stop if incident occurs — report immediately before continuing work\n\n**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → Privacy officer (for breach determination) → Compliance lead\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* Incident reports document: what happened, when, who was involved, what PHI was involved, immediate actions taken  \n* Privacy officer documents breach determination with risk assessment",

Employee applies Minimum Necessary when forwarding: removes name, keeps claim number only, subject line generic (\"Claim status update\").\n\n**Why Compliant:** Accurate PHI identification, Minimum Necessary applied proactively.\n\n**Compliant Example 2 \\- Incident Reporting:** Employee composes email to payer, types recipient email address, auto-complete suggests similar address, employee notices wrong recipient before sending, deletes draft. Employee reports as near-miss incident: \"Almost sent PHI to wrong recipient, caught during address verification, no disclosure occurred.\"\n\n**Why Compliant:** Near-miss reported even though no disclosure occurred; demonstrates incident awareness.\n\n**Non-Compliant Example:** Employee sends PHI to wrong recipient (auto-complete error). Employee realizes mistake, recalls email (recall fails), deletes sent email from own mailbox. Employee does not report incident, reasoning \"I fixed it so no harm done.\" Three days later, recipient reports receiving PHI not intended for them. Investigation discovers employee's failure to report and evidence deletion (deleted sent email).\n\n**Why Non-Compliant:** Multiple violations: failure to report incident immediately, evidence destruction, self-determination that \"no harm\" means no reporting needed. Results in sanctions (potentially acceleration clause for evidence destruction).",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Item 1 (MCQ):** PHI requires which two elements? A) Identifier \\+ location  \n B) Identifier \\+ health/payment context  \n C) Health context \\+ date  \n D) Electronic format \\+ security\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** PHI \\= identifier \\+ health/payment context per definition.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — missing identifier element.\n\n**Item 2 (MCQ):** Which is NOT PHI? A) Patient name \\+ diagnosis  \n B) Account number \\+ claim status  \n C) \"Diabetes education class schedule\"  \n D) MRN \\+ medication list\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** No identifier present in general class schedule.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — MRN \\+ medication is clearly PHI.\n\n**Item 3 (True/False):** ePHI and paper PHI have identical handling requirements.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** ePHI requires additional technical safeguards (encryption, access logs); paper requires physical safeguards (locked storage, shredding).\n\n**Item 4 (MCQ):** Minimum Necessary does NOT apply to: A) Documentation  \n B) Treatment activities  \n C) Communication with colleagues  \n D) Access requests\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Treatment activities exempt from Minimum Necessary; providers may access all relevant PHI for treatment.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — access requests DO require Minimum Necessary.\n\n**Item 5 (MCQ):** An incident includes: A) Only events where harm occurred  \n B) Only events where PHI was disclosed  \n C) Any violation or risk event including near-misses  \n D) Only breaches\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Incidents include near-misses and any policy violation/risk event.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — harm is not required for incident classification.\n\n**Item 6 (MCQ):** Who determines if an incident is a breach? A) The employee who caused it  \n B) The supervisor  \n C) The privacy officer  \n D) The compliance committee\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Privacy officer conducts risk assessment and determines breach status.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** B — supervisor receives report but does not determine breach.\n\n**Item 7 (Scenario MCQ):** You write a note: \"Pt called re: balance inquiry. Explained statement. F/U if needed.\" Does this contain PHI? A) No, no identifiers present  \n B) Yes, \"pt\" is identifier  \n C) Ambiguous, depends on system context  \n D) Only if note includes account number\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** If note is filed under patient account in system, \"pt\" in context identifies individual \\+ payment context \\= PHI. Outside system context without linkage, may not be PHI.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — missing system context consideration.\n\n**Item 8 (True/False):** If you catch a mistake before PHI is disclosed (near-miss), you do not need to report it as an incident.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Near-misses are reportable incidents; demonstrates risk awareness.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — \"no harm \\= no report\" misconception.\n\n**Item 9 (MCQ):** Minimum Necessary means: A) Use the smallest font size  \n B) Disclose only what's needed for the purpose  \n C) Always use account numbers instead of names  \n D) Limit access to supervisors only\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Minimum Necessary \\= only disclose/use/request what's needed for specific purpose.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — account numbers are not always \"less\" than names; depends on purpose.\n\n**Item 10 (MCQ):** Which is ePHI? A) Paper chart in file cabinet  \n B) Verbal conversation in hallway  \n C) Email containing patient name and diagnosis  \n D) Handwritten note on clipboard\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Email is electronic format; contains identifier \\+ health context \\= ePHI.\n\n**Item 11 (Scenario MCQ):** You need to route a ticket to another pod. Ticket contains name, MRN, phone, DOB, diagnosis, and issue description (\"needs prior auth for MRI\"). What do you include in routing message applying Minimum Necessary? A) All fields to give complete picture  \n B) Account number \\+ issue description only  \n C) Name \\+ diagnosis \\+ issue  \n D) MRN \\+ issue description only\n\n**Answer:** D  \n **Rationale:** MRN identifies patient (necessary for routing), issue description (necessary for action). Other fields unnecessary for routing purpose.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — violates Minimum Necessary by including all fields.\n\n**Item 12 (True/False):** \"Unsecured PHI\" means PHI not encrypted or destroyed per federal standards.\n\n**Answer:** True  \n **Rationale:** Definition of unsecured PHI requires encryption/destruction to render unusable.\n\n**Item 13 (MCQ):** You accidentally access a patient record without authorization (curiosity browsing). You immediately close the record and do nothing else. What is this? A) Not an incident because you closed it quickly  \n B) An incident requiring immediate reporting  \n C) A breach requiring patient notification  \n D) Acceptable if you don't tell anyone\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Unauthorized access is an incident requiring immediate reporting regardless of duration.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — \"quick\" does not excuse unauthorized access.\n\n**Item 14 (Short Answer):** Define PHI in one sentence using both required elements.\n\n**Answer:** PHI is information that identifies or can identify an individual AND relates to the individual's health condition, healthcare provision, or healthcare payment.\n\n**Rationale:** Must include both identifier and health/payment context.\n\n**Item 15 (MCQ):** Which statement about breach determination is correct? A) Employees determine breach status based on severity  \n B) Privacy officer determines breach status after risk assessment  \n C) All incidents are automatically breaches  \n D) Only incidents with patient complaints are breaches\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Privacy officer conducts formal risk assessment to determine breach status.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — not all incidents are breaches; requires significant risk determination.",

For each module:  \n   * Read entry-level primer first (plain language overview)  \n   * Study definitions section (terms you will use)  \n   * Read step-by-step procedures carefully (these are your work instructions)  \n   * Review worked examples (see correct vs incorrect application)  \n   * Complete practice pack activities (drills, scenarios, simulations)  \n   * Take knowledge check when ready (review passing standard and attempt limits first)  \n4. After passing knowledge check: system marks module complete automatically  \n5. Proceed to next module only after current module marked complete  \n6. Access job aids referenced in modules (stored in shared drive or LMS resource library)  \n7. Bookmark or download job aids for use during actual work performance\n\n**Procedure: Use Job Aids Effectively**\n\n1. Identify job aid needed for task (e.g., verification script, phishing checklist, redaction template)  \n2. Access job aid from designated storage location  \n3. Follow job aid step-by-step during task performance (job aids are designed for real-time use, not memorization)  \n4. Check off steps if job aid has checklist format  \n5. Document use of job aid if required by task (e.g., \"Used verification script per job aid\")  \n6. If job aid is unclear or seems outdated: escalate to supervisor; do not improvise\n\n**Procedure: Apply Safe Stop Rules**\n\n**Safe Stop Rule 1: Stop if Identity Not Verified**\n\n* Before disclosing PHI, granting access, or processing requests: verify requester identity  \n* Use approved verification method (Module 4 will detail methods)  \n* If verification fails or cannot be completed: stop, do not disclose, offer alternative (e.g., secure callback, written request)  \n* Document verification attempt outcome\n\n**Safe Stop Rule 2: Stop if Channel Not Approved**\n\n* Before sending, storing, or discussing PHI: confirm channel is approved for client  \n* Approved channel list is client-specific (needs\\_review; Module 7 will detail)  \n* If uncertain whether channel is approved: stop, escalate to supervisor  \n* Never use personal email, SMS, WhatsApp, or social media for PHI regardless of encryption\n\n**Safe Stop Rule 3: Stop if Request Purpose Unclear**\n\n* Before disclosing PHI: understand and document why information is needed  \n* If requester cannot or will not state clear purpose: stop, do not disclose  \n* \"Just checking\" or \"general inquiry\" is not sufficient purpose  \n* Document unclear purpose and escalate\n\n**Safe Stop Rule 4: Stop if Rushed or Pressured to Bypass Steps**\n\n* If requester or supervisor pressures you to skip verification, documentation, or other controls: stop  \n* State: \"I need to follow the required procedure for compliance. This will take \\[X minutes\\].\"  \n* If pressure continues: stop interaction, escalate to compliance immediately  \n* Document pressure attempt (who, when, what was requested)\n\n**Safe Stop Rule 5: Escalate with Minimal Necessary Context**\n\n* When escalating any issue: share only what supervisor needs to provide guidance  \n* Avoid using patient names, diagnoses, or other identifiers in escalation message unless essential  \n* Example escalation: \"I have a caller requesting test results but cannot verify identity using our script. How should I proceed?\" (no patient identifiers needed)  \n* If PHI must be mentioned: use secure escalation channel (in-person, secure messaging, not hallway conversation)\n\n**Safe Stop Decision Tree:**\n\n1. Does situation involve PHI? (Yes → continue to step 2\\)  \n2. Is identity verified? (No → STOP, apply Rule 1\\)  \n3. Is channel approved? (No → STOP, apply Rule 2\\)  \n4. Is purpose clear? (No → STOP, apply Rule 3\\)  \n5. Am I being rushed/pressured? (Yes → STOP, apply Rule 4\\)  \n6. If any uncertainty remains → STOP, apply Rule 5 (escalate with minimal context)\n\n**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → Compliance lead → Privacy officer (for PHI-related safe stops)\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* Safe stop trigger documented in incident report or task note  \n* Escalation documented with timestamp and decision outcome  \n* No PHI in escalation documentation unless secure method used",

Let me complete the form and I'll have the information to you in 5 minutes.\" Completes form, documents pressure attempt in note, provides information through proper channel.\n\n**Why Compliant:** Applied Rule 4, did not bypass procedure despite pressure, documented incident (pressure to bypass controls).\n\n**Non-Compliant Example:** Employee receives email request for patient records from external email address claiming to be \"Dr. Smith from Cardiology Associates.\" Email looks professional. Employee is busy and email seems legitimate. Employee attaches records and sends without verifying requester identity through approved method. Email address was spoofed; PHI sent to wrong person.

Caller cannot provide DOB after three attempts → Rule 1 (Identity)  \n2. Asked to send PHI via WhatsApp → Rule 2 (Channel)  \n3. Request for \"general information about patient\" → Rule 3 (Purpose)  \n4. Supervisor says \"skip verification, it's urgent\" → Rule 4 (Pressure)  \n5. Need help with complex disclosure decision → Rule 5 (Escalate)  \n6. Email from unknown external address requesting records → Rule 1 (Identity) \\+ Rule 2 (Channel)  \n7. Family member \"just wants to know if patient is okay\" → Rule 3 (Purpose) \\+ Rule 1 (Identity)  \n8. Client asks you to \"just look up neighbor's diagnosis quickly\" → Rule 1 (Identity \\- not verified as having access need) \\+ Rule 3 (Purpose)  \n9. Uncertain if Teams is approved for this client → Rule 2 (Channel)  \n10. Colleague says \"hurry up, just give me the password\" → Rule 4 (Pressure) \\+ other policy violations\n\n**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** You receive a call. Caller says: \"This is Dr. Johnson's office calling about the MRI authorization for our mutual patient Sarah Lee, DOB 3/15/1980. We need the status right away because she's scheduled tomorrow morning. Can you just tell me quickly if it's approved?\"\n\n**Question:** Which safe stop rules apply and what is your response?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n* **Rule 1 (Identity):** Caller identity not verified using approved method (Module 4 will detail verification for provider calls). Must verify caller is actually from Dr. Johnson's office.  \n* **Rule 3 (Purpose):** Purpose stated (authorization status) but must confirm this is valid TPO disclosure per Module 2 framework.  \n* **Rule 4 (Pressure):** \"Right away,\" \"quickly,\" \"scheduled tomorrow\" creates urgency pressure.\n\n**Response:** \"I need to verify your identity first using our provider verification process. This will take about 2-3 minutes. May I have the office phone number so I can call back to confirm?\" OR \"I need to verify you are calling from Dr. Johnson's office. Can you provide \\[approved verification factors per client policy needs\\_review\\]?\"\n\nIf verification succeeds and disclosure is permitted: provide authorization status. If verification fails: offer to send status via secure provider portal or fax to verified number. Document verification outcome and disclosure decision.\n\n**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Caller requesting information  \n **Learner plays:** Employee handling request\n\n**Round 1 \\- Rule 1 Trigger:**  \n **Trainer:** \"Hi, this is John Smith. I need my wife's test results. We share everything.\"\n\n**Learner expected actions:**\n\n* Request verification factors (name, DOB, last-four SSN per client script needs\\_review)  \n* If \"John Smith\" cannot verify as patient or authorized representative: STOP  \n* Respond: \"I'm unable to verify your authorization to receive this information. I can send a secure message to the patient with instructions to share the results with you, or the patient can call us directly.\"  \n* Document: refused disclosure due to verification failure\n\n**Round 2 \\- Rule 2 Trigger:**  \n **Trainer:** \"Can you just text me the results at this number?\"\n\n**Learner expected actions:**\n\n* STOP  \n* Respond: \"Text message is not an approved channel for test results. I can send results via secure patient portal, or you can receive them during an office visit.\"  \n* Document: offered approved alternatives\n\n**Round 3 \\- Rule 4 Trigger:**  \n **Trainer:** \"I'm in the ER right now and the doctor needs this immediately\\! Don't make me wait for your procedures\\!\"\n\n**Learner expected actions:**\n\n* STOP  \n* Respond calmly: \"I understand the urgency. I need to follow verification procedures to protect your information. This will take 2-3 minutes. Let's start with your date of birth.\"  \n* If caller refuses verification: \"I'm unable to proceed without verification. If you're in the ER, the ER physician can request records through the provider channel, which may be faster.\"  \n* Document: attempted disclosure under pressure, maintained verification requirement\n\n**Checklist: Safe Stop Rules Readiness**\n\n* \\[ \\] Can list all five safe stop rules from memory  \n* \\[ \\] Can identify safe stop triggers in scenarios  \n* \\[ \\] Knows how to respond when safe stop triggered (stop, assess, escalate or use approved alternative)  \n* \\[ \\] Understands safe stop rules override other instructions  \n* \\[ \\] Knows escalation path for safe stop situations  \n* \\[ \\] Can escalate with minimal necessary context (Rule 5\\)  \n* \\[ \\] Understands documentation requirements for safe stops\n\n**Scoring Rubric:**\n\n* Safe stop rule identification: 5 points (one per rule)  \n* Scenario application: 3 points  \n* Escalation procedure: 2 points  \n* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \\= 80% passing)**",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Item 1 (MCQ):** How many safe stop rules exist? A) 3  \n B) 4  \n C) 5  \n D) 7\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Five safe stop rules: identity, channel, purpose, pressure, escalate.\n\n**Item 2 (MCQ):** Safe stop rules: A) Are suggestions for best practice  \n B) Can be overridden by supervisors if urgent  \n C) Always apply and override conflicting instructions  \n D) Only apply during training\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Safe stop rules are mandatory and override conflicting instructions including from supervisors.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** B — urgency does not override safe stop rules.\n\n**Item 3 (True/False):** If a caller cannot verify identity, you can disclose PHI if they sound legitimate.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Rule 1 requires identity verification; \"sounds legitimate\" is not verification.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — relying on judgment instead of verification procedure.\n\n**Item 4 (MCQ):** Which is an example of Rule 2 (approved channel) violation? A) Calling patient at verified phone number  \n B) Sending PHI via WhatsApp  \n C) Using secure patient portal  \n D) Faxing to verified fax number\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** WhatsApp is banned channel regardless of encryption.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — fax to verified number is typically approved (needs\\_review per client).\n\n**Item 5 (MCQ):** \"I just want to check on my neighbor\" is an example of which safe stop trigger? A) Identity not verified  \n B) Channel not approved  \n C) Purpose unclear  \n D) Pressure to bypass\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** \"Just checking\" is insufficient purpose; also identity/authorization issue.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — while also an identity issue, the primary trigger here is unclear purpose.\n\n**Item 6 (Scenario MCQ):** Your supervisor says \"I need this patient file immediately, don't bother with the access request form.\" What do you do? A) Follow supervisor's instruction to save time  \n B) Apply Rule 4, complete the form, document the pressure  \n C) Escalate to compliance without doing anything  \n D) Provide the file but complete the form afterward\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Rule 4 requires stopping when pressured to bypass procedures; maintain procedure and document pressure.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — supervisor instruction does not override safe stop rule.\n\n**Item 7 (MCQ):** When escalating a PHI-related question to your supervisor, you should: A) Include all patient details so supervisor has full context  \n B) Use minimal necessary context, avoiding PHI when possible  \n C) Wait until end of shift to escalate  \n D) Escalate via public channel like team chat\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Rule 5 requires minimal necessary context during escalation.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — unnecessary PHI in escalation creates additional exposure.\n\n**Item 8 (True/False):** Job aids are only for new employees; experienced employees should have procedures memorized.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Job aids are designed for real-time use at all experience levels to ensure consistency.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — misconception that memorization replaces job aids.\n\n**Item 9 (MCQ):** You are uncertain if Microsoft Teams is approved for sharing X-rays with this client. What do you do? A) Use Teams since Microsoft is secure  \n B) Apply Rule 2 (channel), escalate to confirm approval before using  \n C) Ask a colleague and follow their advice  \n D) Use email instead\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Rule 2 requires confirmation of channel approval when uncertain.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — general security does not equal client-specific approval.\n\n**Item 10 (MCQ):** Which statement about safe stop rules is correct? A) Apply only if you remember them during the situation  \n B) Apply reflexively; they are mandatory halt conditions  \n C) Apply after completing the task if there was a problem  \n D) Apply only during training period\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Safe stop rules are reflexive mandatory conditions, not retrospective.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — must apply during the situation, not after.\n\n**Item 11 (Scenario MCQ):** External email address requests patient records. Email has correct letterhead and looks professional. What is your first safe stop check? A) Verify requester identity using approved method  \n B) Check if request purpose is clear  \n C) Confirm channel is approved for external disclosure  \n D) All of the above\n\n**Answer:** D  \n **Rationale:** All three rules apply: identity verification (Rule 1), external email channel verification (Rule 2), purpose assessment (Rule 3).  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A only — missing that multiple rules can apply simultaneously.\n\n**Item 12 (True/False):** If three safe stop rules are triggered simultaneously, you can address them in any order.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Use safe stop decision tree order: identity first, then channel, then purpose; all must be satisfied.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — order matters for systematic risk reduction.\n\n**Item 13 (MCQ):** A job aid is: A) A test to assess your knowledge  \n B) A reference document used during work performance  \n C) A training module  \n D) A policy document\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Job aid definition is reference for just-in-time use during tasks.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — job aids are procedural tools, not policy statements.\n\n**Item 14 (Short Answer):** List the five safe stop rules (triggers).\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. Stop if identity not verified  \n2. Stop if channel not approved  \n3. Stop if request purpose unclear  \n4. Stop if rushed/pressured to bypass steps  \n5. Escalate with minimal necessary context\n\n**Rationale:** Core safe stop rules all learners must know.\n\n**Item 15 (Scenario MCQ):** You need help determining if a disclosure is permitted. You escalate to your supervisor by email saying: \"I have a caller named Sarah Lee, DOB 3/15/1980, asking about her husband's cancer diagnosis. Can I disclose?\" What is wrong with this escalation? A) Nothing; supervisor needs full context  \n B) Violated Rule 5 by including unnecessary PHI in escalation  \n C) Should have called instead of emailing  \n D)\n\nShould have escalated by phone\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Rule 5 requires minimal necessary context; escalation question could be asked without patient name, DOB, or diagnosis: \"Spouse is requesting other spouse's diagnosis. What verification/authorization is needed?\"  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — including unnecessary PHI violates Rule 5\\.",

PHI exists when you have BOTH an identifier (name, number, contact info, etc.) AND health or payment context. Your job requires you to read emails, tickets, notes, screenshots, and portal screens constantly — you must scan for PHI before using or sharing any content. Misidentifying PHI causes most data incidents. This module trains you to identify PHI in mixed content and apply redaction before sharing.\n\n**Observable Behaviors:**\n\n* Scans all work content for PHI before forwarding or sharing  \n* Identifies identifiers and health/payment context separately, then confirms both present  \n* Applies redaction to remove unnecessary PHI before sharing  \n* Escalates with sanitized excerpt when uncertain about PHI status",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Procedure: Identify PHI in Any Work Object**\n\n1. Identify object type receiving or reviewing (email, ticket, note, screenshot, document, portal screen, verbal conversation)  \n2. Scan for identifiers using systematic approach:  \n   * Names (patient, guarantor, family members if linked)  \n   * Numbers (MRN, account number, claim number, insurance ID, SSN, phone number)  \n   * Contact information (email, physical address, fax)  \n   * Dates (DOB, admission, discharge, appointment dates, dates of service)  \n   * Photos or images containing identifiable persons  \n   * Account IDs or other unique identifiers  \n3. Scan for health or payment context:  \n   * Diagnosis, symptoms, complaints  \n   * Treatment, procedures, medications  \n   * Test results, clinical observations  \n   * Appointment reasons or clinical service descriptions  \n   * Claim status, payment information, billing details  \n   * Insurance coverage or benefits information  \n4. Apply two-element test:  \n   * If identifier present BUT no health/payment context: may be sensitive but not PHI (e.g., patient name in general directory)  \n   * If health/payment context present BUT no identifier: may be sensitive but not PHI (e.g., \"patient with diabetes\" in training with no identifiers)  \n   * If BOTH identifier AND health/payment context present: treat as PHI  \n5. When uncertain: treat as PHI and escalate with sanitized excerpt (Rule 5 from Module 0.6)  \n6. Before sharing or storing outside primary system: apply minimum necessary redaction (remove unnecessary identifiers or context)\n\n**Procedure: Apply Redaction Before Sharing**\n\n1. Confirm purpose of sharing (why does recipient need this information?)  \n2. Identify minimum necessary elements for that purpose  \n3. Redact using approved method:  \n   * Electronic documents: use redaction tool (permanent removal, not highlighting or strike-through)  \n   * Emails: copy needed text to new email, do not forward with thread history containing extra PHI  \n   * Screenshots: never take screenshots of PHI screens (Module 3 will reinforce); if existing screenshot must be shared for training, redact identifiers permanently  \n   * Tickets: use structured fields to limit PHI, avoid free-text dumps  \n4. Verify redaction permanence (cannot be removed or reversed)  \n5. Confirm redacted version removes all unnecessary PHI  \n6. Share redacted version only  \n7. Document redaction in share note if required by procedure\n\n**Safe Stop Rules:**\n\n* Stop if unsure whether content contains PHI — treat as PHI until confirmed otherwise  \n* Stop if you cannot determine minimum necessary scope — escalate before sharing  \n* Stop if redaction method is unclear — escalate for approved tool/technique\n\n**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → Compliance lead (for complex PHI determination questions)\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* Redaction decisions documented in ticket or share notes (\"Redacted name and DOB per minimum necessary\")  \n* Uncertain PHI status escalations documented with sanitized excerpt only",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Compliant Example 1:** Ticket note reads: \"Pt \\+ account 789456 called re aged balance. Coverage update provided. Requested resubmission via approved portal method. F/U scheduled.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n* Identifiers: \"Pt\" (ambiguous but in system context identifies patient), account number 789456  \n* Health/payment context: \"aged balance,\" \"coverage,\" \"resubmission\" (payment context)  \n* PHI present: Yes (identifier \\+ payment context)  \n* Minimum necessary applied: Uses \"pt\" abbreviation instead of full name, provides account number (necessary for record tracking), describes action without unnecessary clinical detail\n\n**Why Compliant:** PHI minimized while maintaining necessary documentation for continuity.\n\n**Compliant Example 2:** Training artifact created from real ticket. All patient names, account numbers, phone numbers, dates of service, and diagnosis details removed. Template shows only: \"Patient contacted regarding \\[issue type\\]. Action: \\[generic action\\]. Outcome: \\[generic outcome\\].\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n* Original contained PHI  \n* Redaction removed all identifiers  \n* Health/payment context genericized to point of non-identification  \n* Artifact suitable for training\n\n**Why Compliant:** Complete removal of PHI for training use; no identifiable information remains.\n\n**Non-Compliant Example:** Screenshot of live patient portal showing patient name \"Sarah Johnson,\" DOB, MRN, diagnosis \"leukemia,\" and appointment list. Screenshot sent via email with subject \"Quick question about portal layout\" to colleague for help troubleshooting navigation issue.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n* Multiple identifiers present: name, DOB, MRN  \n* Health context present: diagnosis, appointments  \n* PHI clearly present  \n* Screenshot unnecessary for navigation question  \n* Email subject contains no PHI but body/attachment contains significant PHI  \n* Purpose (navigation help) does not require patient identifiers\n\n**Why Non-Compliant:** Screenshots of PHI screens prohibited (Module 3 will reinforce). Purpose did not require identifiable patient data; could have used training environment or described navigation issue without screenshot. Creates incident requiring immediate reporting and escalation per Module 10\\. Sanctions likely (potentially acceleration clause depending on severity and repeat patterns).",

Email thread with patient name in history section three emails down, current email has no identifiers.\n\n    * **Answer:** Yes (thread contains PHI). Must review entire thread before forwarding.  \n12. Portal screen showing \"Patient Dashboard\" title but all patient fields blank (test environment).\n\n    * **Answer:** No. Test environment with no actual patient data.  \n13. \"Our clinic treats pediatric asthma cases.\"\n\n    * **Answer:** No. General service description, no patient identifiers.  \n14. \"Sarah Lee, DOB 3/15/80, needs appointment rescheduled.\"\n\n    * **Answer:** Yes. Identifiers: name \\+ DOB. Health context: appointment (healthcare provision).  \n15. Faxed document with patient name and diagnosis on page 1, page 2 is blank template.\n\n    * **Answer:** Yes (document contains PHI on page 1). Cannot share page 2 alone if it was part of PHI-containing fax.\n\n**Scoring:** 80% required \\= 12/15 correct\n\n**Scenario Exercise:** **Scenario:** You receive email from clinic staff: \"Can you help me understand why this claim denied? \\[Screenshot attached showing patient name, MRN, claim number, denial code, denial reason 'diagnosis not specific enough'\\]\" You know how to resolve the issue (needs more specific diagnosis from provider). How do you respond applying PHI identification and minimum necessary?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. Identify PHI in email: Screenshot contains identifiers (name, MRN, claim number) \\+ payment context (claim, denial) \\= PHI present  \n2. Assess minimum necessary for response: Clinic staff needs to know resolution steps; does NOT need you to reference patient-specific details in your response  \n3. Respond: \"The denial reason 'diagnosis not specific enough' requires provider documentation update. The provider should review the record and submit a more specific diagnosis code. I can help you with the resubmission process after the documentation is updated. Please do not send screenshots with patient information via email; you can reference the claim number only or call me to discuss.\"  \n4. Document: Do not forward screenshot further; if you need to escalate, reference claim number only\n\n**Why Compliant:** Provided resolution guidance without repeating patient identifiers, educated sender on screenshot prohibition, applied minimum necessary in response.\n\n**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Colleague asking for help  \n **Learner plays:** Employee applying PHI identification\n\n**Trainer:** \"Hey, can you look at this ticket? I'm not sure what to do next. \\[Shows screen with patient name, DOB, account number, and issue description visible\\]\"\n\n**Learner expected actions:**\n\n* Observe screen contains PHI (name, DOB, account number visible)  \n* Assess own need-to-know: \"Do I have access rights to this patient's account?\"  \n* If yes (authorized to help): Review ticket details as shown, provide guidance  \n* If no (not authorized): \"I cannot view patient details I'm not authorized for. Can you describe the issue without showing me the patient-specific screen? Or we can escalate to your supervisor.\"  \n* Remind colleague: \"In future, please describe the issue type without showing patient identifiers when asking for general guidance.\"\n\n**Checklist: PHI Identification and Redaction**\n\n* \\[ \\] Scanned object for identifiers (names, numbers, contacts, dates, images)  \n* \\[ \\] Scanned object for health/payment context (diagnosis, treatment, claims, benefits)  \n* \\[ \\] Applied two-element test (both identifier AND context \\= PHI)  \n* \\[ \\] If PHI present: determined minimum necessary for purpose  \n* \\[ \\] If sharing: redacted unnecessary PHI permanently  \n* \\[ \\] If uncertain: treated as PHI and escalated with sanitized excerpt  \n* \\[ \\] Documented redaction decision or escalation\n\n**Scoring Rubric:**\n\n* PHI identification accuracy (15-item drill): 5 points (80% \\= 12/15)  \n* Redaction procedure: 2 points  \n* Scenario application: 2 points  \n* Checklist completion: 1 point  \n* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \\= 80% passing)**",

A) Patient name \\+ diagnosis  \n B) MRN \\+ medication list  \n C) \"Diabetes education class schedule\" (no patient names)  \n D) Account number \\+ claim status\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** No identifier present in general class schedule.\n\n**Item 3 (True/False):** An email thread containing PHI in older messages is not PHI if your current reply has no PHI.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Entire thread must be assessed; historical PHI makes thread PHI-containing.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — forgetting to review full thread history.\n\n**Item 4 (MCQ):** Before sharing a ticket excerpt with a colleague, you should: A) Forward the entire ticket for complete context  \n B) Redact unnecessary PHI and share minimum necessary  \n C) Ask colleague to look over your shoulder instead  \n D) Print and hand-deliver to avoid electronic trail\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Apply minimum necessary through redaction before sharing.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — full ticket likely contains more PHI than necessary.\n\n**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** A screenshot shows portal navigation buttons but no patient data visible. Is this PHI? A) Yes, portal screenshots are always PHI  \n B) No, no patient identifiers or health context visible  \n C) Yes, portal implies healthcare context  \n D) Depends on who views it\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** PHI requires identifier \\+ context; blank navigation screen has neither.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — not all portal screenshots contain PHI; depends on content.\n\n**Item 6 (MCQ):** \"Pt \\+ acct 789 called re balance\" contains: A) No PHI  \n B) Identifier only  \n C) Health context only  \n D) PHI (identifier \\+ payment context)\n\n**Answer:** D  \n **Rationale:** \"Pt\" \\+ account number (identifiers) \\+ balance (payment context) \\= PHI.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** B — missing that \"balance\" is payment context.\n\n**Item 7 (True/False):** If you are unsure whether content contains PHI, you should treat it as non-PHI to avoid over-restricting workflow.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Safe stop rule: if uncertain, treat as PHI and escalate.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — underestimating risk of misidentification.\n\n**Item 8 (MCQ):** Redaction means: A) Highlighting PHI in yellow  \n B) Using strike-through text  \n C) Permanent removal or obscuring that cannot be reversed  \n D) Saving file in protected folder\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Redaction must be permanent and irreversible.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** B — strike-through can often be removed.\n\n**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** You need to show a trainer how to complete a specific form field. The form has patient data populated. What do you do? A) Show the live form as-is  \n B) Use a test environment or blank template  \n C) Verbally describe without showing screen  \n D) Show quickly so it's not a disclosure\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Training should use test environments or blank templates, not live PHI.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — duration does not exempt from PHI handling rules.\n\n**Item 10 (MCQ):** DOB alone without any other identifier is: A) Always PHI  \n B) Never PHI  \n C) PHI if combined with health/payment context and can identify individual  \n D) Only PHI for children\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** DOB becomes PHI when combined with health context and can identify individual (especially if rare DOB in dataset).  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** B — DOB can be PHI in combination.\n\n**Item 11 (MCQ):** Which scenario requires immediate PHI incident reporting? A) You identify PHI in a ticket and redact before sharing  \n B) You accidentally view PHI you don't need, immediately close, report  \n C) You apply minimum necessary successfully  \n D) You ask supervisor if content contains PHI\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Unnecessary access (even if immediately corrected) is reportable incident.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — proper redaction before sharing is compliant, not an incident.\n\n**Item 12 (True/False):** \"Patient with hypertension\" in a training scenario with no names or numbers is PHI.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** No identifier present; health context alone is not PHI.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — confusing sensitive content with PHI.\n\n**Item 13 (MCQ):** Direct identifiers include: A) Age and gender  \n B) Name and MRN  \n C) Diagnosis and treatment  \n D) State and city\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Direct identifiers immediately identify individuals (name, MRN, SSN, etc.).  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — age and gender are attributes but not direct identifiers.\n\n**Item 14 (Scenario MCQ):** Colleague asks \"Can you check if John Smith's claim processed?\" How do you respond applying minimum necessary? A) \"Yes, I'll check John Smith's claim.\"  \n B) \"What is the account or claim number? I'll check by that.\"  \n C) \"I cannot help with patient-specific questions.\"  \n D) \"Let me look up John Smith in the system.\"\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Use account/claim number (necessary) instead of name when possible (minimum necessary).  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — repeating name unnecessarily in your response.\n\n**Item 15 (MCQ):** ePHI includes: A) Only encrypted data  \n B) Only data in electronic health records  \n C) Any PHI created, stored, transmitted, or received electronically  \n D) Only data on secure servers\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** ePHI is any PHI in electronic form regardless of security status or location.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** B — not limited to EHRs.\n\n**Item 16 (True/False):** Indirect identifiers can only identify individuals when combined with other information.\n\n**Answer:** True  \n **Rationale:** Indirect identifiers (age over 89, small geographic areas, rare dates) identify in combination.\n\n**Item 17 (MCQ):** You create training materials from real tickets. What must you do? A) Use tickets as-is for realism  \n B) Remove all identifiers and genericize health/payment context  \n C) Only remove patient names  \n D) Encrypt the files\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Training artifacts must be fully de-identified (all identifiers removed, context genericized).  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — removing only names leaves other identifiers (account numbers, dates, etc.).\n\n**Item 18 (Scenario MCQ):** You receive fax with patient name on page 1 and blank form on page 2\\. You need to share the blank form with a colleague as a template. What do you do? A) Share page 2 only  \n B) Share entire fax since page 2 is blank  \n C) Recreate blank form from scratch or use approved template library  \n D) Redact name on page 1 and share both pages\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Even blank page from PHI-containing document may carry contamination risk; use approved templates or recreate.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — separating pages may not fully remove association with PHI document.\n\n**Item 19 (Short Answer):** List three examples of direct identifiers.\n\n**Answer:** (Any three of: name, MRN, SSN, account number, phone number, email address, physical address, photo, biometric data, IP address, device ID)\n\n**Rationale:** Direct identifiers immediately identify individuals.\n\n**Item 20 (Scenario MCQ):** Ticket note says \"Contact provided re aged balance. Action: sent statement.\" Contains account number in system but not in note text. Is the note PHI? A) No, note text has no identifiers  \n B) Yes, account number in system associates note with patient  \n C) Only if you copy the note outside the system  \n D) Only if amount is visible\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Note in patient account context creates identifier association even if note text doesn't repeat identifier.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — context within system creates PHI association.",

Your role is NOT to independently decide what's allowed — you follow client policy, check for authorization, and escalate when unclear. Mistakes in disclosure decisions cause breaches.\n\n**Observable Behaviors:**\n\n* Identifies requester type (patient, payer, provider, family, internal, other)  \n* Identifies stated purpose (treatment, payment, operations, unknown)  \n* Checks client policy or authorization registry before disclosing  \n* Refuses disclosure using approved script when not clearly permitted  \n* Escalates ambiguous requests with minimal necessary context  \n* Documents disclosure decision basis without extra PHI",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Procedure: Evaluate Disclosure Requests**\n\n1. Identify requester type:\n\n   * Patient themselves (photo ID verification at minimum)  \n   * Patient's authorized representative (requires authorization verification — needs\\_review per client)  \n   * Payer (insurance company, claims processor)  \n   * Provider (referring physician, treating facility, consultant)  \n   * Family member (not automatically authorized)  \n   * Internal staff (must have need-to-know for role)  \n   * Other (attorney, employer, media, law enforcement, etc.)  \n2. Identify stated purpose:\n\n   * Treatment (care coordination, referral, consultation)  \n   * Payment (billing, claim, coverage, prior auth)  \n   * Operations (quality, audit, case management)  \n   * Patient request (patient accessing own information)  \n   * Other/unclear  \n3. Check applicable authority:\n\n   * For patient requests: verify identity using Module 4 procedures  \n   * For payer requests: confirm client policy allows disclosure for stated payment purpose (needs\\_review per client); many require verification of payer identity  \n   * For provider requests: confirm treatment relationship and verify provider identity (needs\\_review per client procedures)  \n   * For family/representative requests: check authorization on file before proceeding  \n   * For other requests: authorization required unless specific law mandates disclosure  \n4. Make disclosure decision:\n\n   * If clearly permitted by client policy AND identity verified AND minimum necessary determined: proceed with disclosure  \n   * If not clearly permitted by client policy: refuse using approved script, offer alternative (e.g., patient can authorize disclosure), escalate if requester persists  \n   * If authorization required but not on file: refuse, explain how to submit authorization  \n   * If uncertain about any element: escalate before disclosing (safe stop Rule 3 and 5\\)  \n5. Document decision basis:\n\n   * Requester type and verified identity  \n   * Stated purpose  \n   * Policy basis for disclosure or refusal  \n   * What was disclosed (minimum necessary items)  \n   * If refused: refusal reason and alternative offered  \n   * If escalated: escalation timestamp and decision outcome\n\n**Procedure: Refuse Disclosure Safely**\n\n1. Listen to full request without interrupting  \n2. Acknowledge request: \"I understand you're requesting \\[information type\\].\"  \n3. State refusal clearly and professionally: \"I'm unable to provide that information without \\[authorization/verification/policy confirmation\\].\"  \n4. Explain reason briefly: \"Our policy requires \\[specific requirement\\] before we can share this information.\"  \n5. Offer alternative: \"You can \\[submit written authorization/contact the patient to request release/verify identity through this process\\].\"  \n6. If requester argues or pressures: repeat refusal calmly, do not deviate from script  \n7. If pressure continues (safe stop Rule 4): \"I need to escalate this request to my supervisor. Please hold or I can call you back within \\[timeframe\\].\"  \n8. End interaction professionally: \"Is there anything else I can help with that doesn't require this information?\"  \n9. Document: requester details, request, refusal reason, alternative offered, any pressure tactics used\n\n**Safe Stop Rules:**\n\n* Stop if stated purpose is unclear or changes during conversation — escalate  \n* Stop if requester cannot or will not verify identity — refuse disclosure  \n* Stop if authorization status is uncertain — escalate before disclosing  \n* Stop if you are being pressured to disclose \"just this once\" — maintain refusal, escalate\n\n**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → Privacy officer (for disclosure decision confirmation)\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* All disclosure decisions documented in disclosure log or ticket with: requester, purpose, authority basis, what disclosed, date/time  \n* Refusals documented with reason and alternative offered  \n* Escalations documented with decision outcome",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Compliant Example 1 \\- Spouse Request (Source Scenario 2):** Caller: \"This is John Smith. I need my wife Sarah's test results. We're married.\"\n\nEmployee: \"I understand you'd like Sarah's test results. Our policy requires authorization from Sarah before I can share her information with anyone else, including spouses. Is Sarah available to speak with me directly, or she can complete an authorization form allowing us to speak with you.\"\n\nCaller: \"She's at work. Can't you just tell me?\"\n\nEmployee: \"I'm unable to share without her authorization. Sarah can call us directly, or if she completes an authorization form naming you, we can discuss her information with you. Would you like me to email her the authorization form instructions at the address we have on file?\"\n\n**Why Compliant:** Correctly identified spouse is not automatically authorized, refused disclosure using script, offered alternatives (patient calls directly or submits authorization), maintained refusal despite pressure, documented interaction.\n\n**Compliant Example 2 \\- Payer Request (needs\\_review for client-specific):** Payer representative calls: \"This is Claims Department at Blue Cross calling about claim 123456 for patient account 789\\. We need the office visit notes to process the claim.\"\n\nEmployee: \"I need to verify your identity first. May I have your name, department, and a callback number at Blue Cross?\" \\[Verifies using client procedure for payer verification — needs\\_review\\]. \"Thank you. Let me confirm our policy allows this disclosure for claims processing purposes.\" \\[Checks policy, confirms payment purpose disclosure permitted\\]. \"I can send the office visit notes via \\[approved method — needs\\_review\\]. The fax number on file is \\[verifies number\\]. You should receive within one business day.\"\n\n**Why Compliant:** Verified payer identity per procedure, confirmed client policy permits payment-purpose disclosure, used approved transmission method, applied minimum necessary (only office visit notes requested, not entire medical record), documented disclosure.\n\n**Non-Compliant Example:** Family member calls: \"Hi, this is Dr. Johnson's daughter. He was admitted yesterday and I'm out of state. Can you tell me what his diagnosis is and when he can go home?\"\n\nEmployee: \"Oh sure, let me look... He has pneumonia and should be discharged tomorrow if his oxygen levels improve.\"\n\n**Why Non-Compliant:** Multiple violations:\n\n* Did not verify identity (family member may not be who they claim)  \n* Did not check for authorization on file before disclosing to family member  \n* Disclosed diagnosis and treatment plan without confirming daughter is authorized representative  \n* Did not verify patient wants daughter to have this information  \n* Source Scenario 2 directly addresses this pattern\n\n**Correct Response:** \"I understand you're concerned about your father. Our policy requires me to verify with him that he authorizes me to share his medical information with you. Is he available to speak with me now? Alternatively, he can complete an authorization form that allows us to speak with specific family members.\"",

Patient requests own test results after verifying identity → A (patient right to access)  \n2. Spouse requests diagnosis without authorization on file → D (family not automatically authorized)  \n3. Payer requests claim documentation for payment processing, policy confirms permitted → A (payment purpose, policy allows)  \n4. Provider requests records for treatment, but caller identity not verified → E (purpose may be permitted but identity verification incomplete)  \n5. Employer requests employee fitness-for-duty certification → E (requires authorization unless specific workers' comp or required by law)  \n6. Patient's attorney requests records, no authorization on file → D (requires patient authorization)  \n7. Patient's mother requests information, patient is 35 years old → D (adult patient, parent not automatically authorized)  \n8. Internal staff member requests access, but purpose is unclear → E (internal access requires need-to-know; unclear purpose triggers escalation)  \n9. Law enforcement requests records without warrant or subpoena → E (requires legal review of specific circumstances — needs\\_review)  \n10.

Patient verified identity at call start. Case manager asks about upcoming surgery details to coordinate post-op care. Patient is silent. What do you do?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. Acknowledge request: \"I understand you're asking about the surgery to coordinate care.\"  \n2. Verify patient consent in real-time: \"Mr./Ms. \\[Patient\\], are you still on the line? Do you authorize me to discuss your surgery details with \\[Case Manager Name\\] from \\[Insurance Company\\] for care coordination purposes?\"  \n3.

Mr./Ms. \\[Patient\\], you can call me back directly if you'd like to discuss this privately first.\"  \n5. Document: Three-party call, patient verbal authorization obtained (or not obtained), what was disclosed\n\n**Why Correct:** Even though patient initiated the call and verified identity, explicit verbal consent required before discussing PHI with third party on line. Patient silence is not consent.\n\n**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Caller requesting information  \n **Learner plays:** Employee evaluating disclosure request\n\n**Round 1 \\- Pressure Scenario:** **Trainer:** \"This is the billing office at Northside Clinic. We need patient insurance information for Jane Doe immediately. She's here now waiting to be seen and forgot her card.\"\n\n**Learner expected actions:**\n\n1. Identify requester type: provider office (treatment context)  \n2. Verify identity: \"May I have your name, the clinic's phone number, and Jane Doe's date of birth?\"  \n3. Verify patient presence: \"Is Jane available to speak with me directly to authorize this disclosure?\" OR \"Can Jane verify her identity and give permission?\"  \n4. If Jane verifies and authorizes: provide insurance information  \n5. If Jane cannot verify or clinic resists: \"I need Jane to verify directly or we can send information to the clinic through our standard records release process.\"  \n6. If pressured: \"I understand this is urgent for her appointment, but I need to follow our verification procedure to protect Jane's information.\"\n\n**Round 2 \\- Ambiguous Purpose:** **Trainer:** \"Hi, I'm calling from Community Health Partners about one of your patients. Can you tell me what appointments they have coming up?\"\n\n**Learner expected actions:**\n\n1. Identify unclear elements: Which patient? What is specific purpose? Is this treatment coordination or something else?  \n2. Clarify: \"Can you tell me the patient's name and the specific reason you need their appointment information?\"  \n3. Assess stated purpose against TPO framework  \n4. If treatment coordination and identity verifiable: may proceed if policy allows  \n5. If purpose remains unclear: \"I need to escalate this request to verify our policy allows this disclosure. May I call you back at \\[verified number\\]?\"  \n6.

A) Nothing; proceed with disclosure  \n B) Verify payer identity and apply minimum necessary  \n C) Get patient authorization  \n D) Wait for supervisor approval\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Must verify requester identity and apply minimum necessary even for permitted disclosures.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — identity verification still required.\n\n**Item 10 (MCQ):** When refusing disclosure, you should: A) Hang up to avoid argument  \n B) Use refusal script, explain reason briefly, offer alternative  \n C) Explain detailed legal reasons  \n D) Transfer to supervisor immediately\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Professional refusal includes script, brief reason, alternative.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — escalation not needed for straightforward refusals.\n\n**Item 11 (True/False):** \"I'm just checking on my neighbor\" is a sufficient purpose for disclosure.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** \"Just checking\" is insufficient purpose; also no authorization (safe stop Rule 3).  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — not recognizing insufficient purpose.\n\n**Item 12 (MCQ):** Patient requests records be sent to attorney. What do you need? A) Attorney's bar number  \n B) Signed authorization from patient specifying attorney and purpose  \n C) Patient verbal permission  \n D) Court order\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Patient direction requires written authorization specifying recipient and purpose.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — verbal permission insufficient for third-party disclosure.\n\n**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** Internal staff member asks for patient information. They say \"I need it for my work.\" What do you do? A) Provide; they're internal so it's fine  \n B) Ask specific purpose, verify need-to-know, check if they have appropriate access rights  \n C) Deny; internal staff must access systems themselves  \n D) Provide if they're management level\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Internal access requires need-to-know verification and appropriate permissions.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — \"internal\" doesn't eliminate need-to-know requirement.\n\n**Item 14 (Short Answer):** What are the three escalation triggers that should cause you to stop and escalate before making disclosure decision?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. Ambiguous or unclear purpose  \n2. Missing or uncertain authorization status  \n3. Unusual or complex request outside normal workflow\n\n**Rationale:** These situations require privacy officer or supervisor review.\n\n**Item 15 (MCQ):** Documentation of disclosure decisions must include: A) Only what was disclosed  \n B) Requester, purpose, authority basis, what disclosed, date/time  \n C) Only if disclosure was denied  \n D) Patient's medical information for context\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Complete disclosure documentation includes all decision elements.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — both approvals and denials must be documented.",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Procedure: Access Records with Least Privilege**\n\n1. Before opening any patient record, state task purpose in your own words (mental or verbal check): \"I need to \\[specific task\\] for \\[specific reason\\].\"  \n2. Confirm patient identifier matches task (right patient, right account)  \n3. Open only the minimum screens/sections required:  \n   * For benefits verification: demographics and insurance section only  \n   * For payment posting: billing/payment screens only  \n   * For appointment scheduling: scheduling and contact information only  \n   * Avoid opening clinical notes, test results, or diagnoses unless directly required for your specific task  \n4. Complete task efficiently without browsing unrelated sections  \n5. Log out or close record when task complete  \n6. If you accidentally open wrong record or unnecessary section: close immediately, do not read content, document access in incident report if you viewed PHI\n\n**Procedure: Recognize and Prevent Curiosity Browsing**\n\n1. Apply curiosity self-check before accessing any record: \"Do I have a job need to access this record right now?\"  \n2. High-risk scenarios requiring extra vigilance:  \n   * Records of celebrities, public figures, or anyone in news  \n   * Records of neighbors, friends, family members, coworkers, yourself  \n   * Records tied to newsworthy events (crimes, accidents, unusual diagnoses)  \n   * Records you're personally interested in for non-work reasons  \n3. If you identify personal interest without job need: STOP, close without accessing, walk away  \n4. If you already accessed without job need (even briefly): close immediately, report as incident to supervisor: \"I accessed \\[account\\] without job need. I closed immediately. Please document this incident.\"  \n5. Understand consequences: curiosity browsing typically results in termination under acceleration clause, even for first offense\n\n**Safe Stop for Curiosity:** If you feel curious — stop and close. Curiosity is never a legitimate job need.\n\n**Procedure: Request Access When Current Permissions Insufficient**\n\n1. Identify specific access need: \"I need \\[specific permission\\] to \\[specific task\\].\"  \n2. Confirm need is ongoing or temporary:  \n   * Ongoing: role-based access request (permanent permission)  \n   * Temporary: time-limited access request with end date  \n3. Complete access request form with required fields:  \n   * Your name and current role  \n   * System/module needing access  \n   * Specific permission level requested (read-only, read-write, etc.)  \n   * Business justification (why needed for job duties)  \n   * If temporary: requested end date  \n   * Supervisor approval signature  \n4. Submit to IT/access management per client procedure (needs\\_review)  \n5. Do not attempt to access before approval granted  \n6. If approval delayed and task urgent: escalate to supervisor; do not improvise workarounds\n\n**Procedure: Audit Your Own Access Permissions (Self-Audit Lab)**\n\n1. Schedule self-audit quarterly or per client requirement (needs\\_review)  \n2. Access your user profile in each system you use  \n3. Review current permissions list  \n4. For each permission, ask: \"Do I currently need this for my role?\"  \n5. Identify unused permissions:  \n   * Permissions from prior role no longer applicable  \n   * Temporary access granted for completed project  \n   * System access for pods/clients no longer assigned to you  \n6. Draft access removal request for identified unused permissions  \n7. Submit to supervisor for approval and processing  \n8. Document self-audit completion with date and findings\n\n**Safe Stop Rules:**\n\n* Stop if you feel curiosity about a record — close without accessing  \n* Stop if you need access you don't have — request formally, do not borrow credentials  \n* Stop if you realize you have permissions you don't use — request removal\n\n**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → IT/access management → Compliance (for access violations)\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* Access requests: system, permission, justification, approval, grant date  \n* Access removals: system, permission removed, date  \n* Self-audit: date conducted, permissions reviewed, removals requested  \n* Curiosity browsing incidents: immediate self-report with account accessed and acknowledgment",

Employee submits to IT, waits for access grant notification, then uses portal for job tasks only.\n\n**Why Compliant:** Formal access request with specific scope and justification, supervisor approved, waited for proper grant, uses for stated purpose only.\n\n**Compliant Example 2:** Employee conducts quarterly self-audit. Discovers they still have \"Pod 3\" permissions from six months ago when temporarily helped that pod. Current assignment is Pod 7 only. Employee drafts access removal request: \"Remove Pod 3 system access. No longer assigned to Pod 3 as of \\[date\\]. Current assignment is Pod 7.\" Submits to supervisor.\n\n**Why Compliant:** Proactive identification of access creep, formal removal request, addresses unused permissions reducing risk.\n\n**Non-Compliant Example (Source Scenario 20 \\- Curiosity Browsing):** Employee lives in neighborhood. Neighbor was in car accident (employee saw ambulance yesterday). Employee is curious about neighbor's condition. Employee opens neighbor's chart during slow work period to \"see diagnosis.\" Record shows multiple injuries and admission details. Employee reads for 2-3 minutes. System audit flags unauthorized access. Investigation confirms employee has no job need to access neighbor's record. Employee terminated under acceleration clause.\n\n**Why Non-Compliant:** Textbook curiosity browsing violation. No job need, access driven purely by personal interest.

That project ended three months ago. You're now back to your regular Collections Pod role. You still have Authorization Pod system access (nobody removed it). Today, a colleague in Authorization Pod asks \"Can you just check this authorization status quickly? You still have access.\"\n\n**Question:** What should you do and why?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. Decline access: \"I no longer have job need for that system since I'm not in Authorization Pod. I should not access it.\"  \n2. Direct colleague: \"Please route this through your pod supervisor or someone currently assigned to Authorization.\"  \n3. File access removal request: Document that Authorization Pod access should be removed (access creep identified)  \n4. If already accessed before realizing: Self-report as incident, document that temporary access wasn't removed after assignment ended\n\n**Why Correct:** Access permissions should match current role. Helping another pod using old permissions violates least privilege even if you're capable of the task. Identifies access creep and takes corrective action.\n\n**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Peer asking for access help  \n **Learner plays:** Employee applying access controls\n\n**Scenario:** \"Hey, I forgot my password and I'm slammed. Can I use your login really quick to check this one account?\"\n\n**Learner expected actions:**\n\n1. Refuse immediately: \"I can't share my credentials. That violates our access policy.\"  \n2. Offer proper alternative: \"Contact IT for a password reset. It usually takes 5-10 minutes.\"  \n3. If peer pressures: \"I understand you're busy, but sharing credentials creates security and compliance issues. I have to say no.\"  \n4. Document pressure attempt if it continues (Source Scenario 13 addresses credential sharing pressure)  \n5. Do NOT log in on peer's behalf or share credentials under any circumstance\n\n**Checklist: Least Privilege Access**\n\n* \\[ \\] Stated task purpose before opening record (mental check minimum)  \n* \\[ \\] Opened only minimum screens needed for specific task  \n* \\[ \\] Did not browse unrelated sections  \n* \\[ \\] Did not access records of known individuals without job need  \n* \\[ \\] Closed record immediately after task completion  \n* \\[ \\] If curiosity arose: stopped and closed without accessing  \n* \\[ \\] If access insufficient: filed formal access request, did not borrow credentials  \n* \\[ \\] Conducted self-audit on schedule, identified unused permissions  \n* \\[ \\] Documented any incidents (accidental access, curiosity stopped, etc.)\n\n**Scoring Rubric:**\n\n* Access scenario identification (8 items): 4 points (7/8 \\= 87.5%)  \n* Least privilege procedure: 2 points  \n* Curiosity prevention: 2 points  \n* Access request/removal understanding: 2 points  \n* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \\= 80% passing)**",

Your colleague offers to let you use their login \"until yours is set up.\" What do you do? A) Accept to avoid workflow delay  \n B) Decline and file formal access request  \n C) Use it but log with your name  \n D) Share your login in exchange\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Credential sharing prohibited; must use formal access request process.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — urgency does not excuse credential sharing (Source Scenario 13).\n\n**Item 6 (MCQ):** Before opening any patient record, you should: A) Check if anyone is watching  \n B) State task purpose and confirm legitimate job need  \n C) Log the access manually  \n D) Ask supervisor permission\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Purpose check before access prevents unauthorized access.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — routine access within role doesn't require per-record supervisor approval.\n\n**Item 7 (True/False):** Accessing a celebrity patient's record is acceptable if you only look briefly and don't tell anyone.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Any curiosity browsing is violation regardless of duration or disclosure.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — \"brief\" and \"didn't share\" do not mitigate unauthorized access.\n\n**Item 8 (MCQ):** Self-audit of access permissions should occur: A) Never; IT manages access  \n B) Only when changing roles  \n C) Quarterly or per client requirement  \n D) Only if supervisor requests\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Periodic self-audit (typically quarterly) identifies access creep.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — employees share responsibility for appropriate access.\n\n**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** You accidentally open wrong patient record. What do you do? A) Close immediately and document if PHI viewed  \n B) Quickly fix your work in the wrong record  \n C) Delete the access log entry  \n D) Tell the patient you accessed their record\n\n**Answer:** A  \n **Rationale:** Immediate closure minimizes exposure; documentation required if PHI viewed (incident reporting).  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — never delete or alter audit logs.\n\n**Item 10 (MCQ):** Access request justification should include: A) Why it would be convenient  \n B) Specific job need and tasks requiring access  \n C) How long you've worked there  \n D) What other people have access\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Justification must demonstrate legitimate job need.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — convenience is insufficient justification.\n\n**Item 11 (True/False):** If you discover you have permissions you no longer need, you can just not use them instead of requesting removal.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Unused permissions should be formally removed to reduce access creep and risk.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — \"not using\" doesn't eliminate the access risk; formal removal required.\n\n**Item 12 (MCQ):** Accessing your neighbor's record to check on their health after you saw an ambulance is: A) Acceptable if you're concerned  \n B) Acceptable if you're a healthcare worker  \n C) Curiosity browsing violation, likely resulting in termination  \n D) Acceptable as long as you don't share information\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Source Scenario 20 explicitly addresses this pattern; curiosity browsing with likely termination.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — concern does not create job need.\n\n**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** Your role is Billing. You can see clinical notes in the system. Should you read them when processing claims? A) Yes, always for complete context  \n B) Only if needed for medical necessity determination per role procedures  \n C) No, never access clinical notes  \n D) Only if claim is complex\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Access only what's needed for specific task; clinical notes may or may not be necessary depending on billing task and role procedures.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — \"complete context\" violates minimum necessary.\n\n**Item 14 (Short Answer):** What are the three types of high-risk curiosity browsing scenarios requiring extra vigilance?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. Records of celebrities, public figures, or people in news  \n2. Records of people you know (neighbors, friends, family, coworkers, yourself)  \n3. Records tied to newsworthy events or unusual cases you're personally interested in\n\n**Rationale:** These scenarios create personal interest that conflicts with job need.\n\n**Item 15 (MCQ):** Consequences of curiosity browsing typically include: A) Counseling for first offense  \n B) Written warning  \n C) Termination under acceleration clause, even first offense  \n D) Mandatory retraining\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Curiosity browsing is high-severity violation typically resulting in immediate termination.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — curiosity browsing bypasses progressive discipline.",

Verification is scripted discipline — follow the script exactly, never skip steps even under pressure. If verification fails after three attempts, terminate interaction politely, do not hint at correct answers, document failure, and escalate.\n\n**Observable Behaviors:**\n\n* States purpose of verification at interaction start  \n* Asks all required verification factors per client script  \n* Does not hint at correct answers when factors mismatch  \n* Terminates interaction after three failures per script  \n* Documents verification outcome (pass/fail, factors used)  \n* Never bypasses verification due to urgency or caller emotion",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Procedure: Verify Patient Identity (Phone or In-Person)**\n\n1. State purpose of verification professionally: \"To protect your privacy, I need to verify your identity before we discuss your information.\"\n\n2. Request first verification factor per client script (needs\\_review for specific factors and order):\n\n   * Common first factor: Full legal name  \n   * Confirm: \"Can you state your full name as it appears in our records?\"  \n3. Request second verification factor:\n\n   * Common second factor: Date of birth (format: MM/DD/YYYY)  \n   * Confirm: \"Can you provide your date of birth?\"  \n4. Request third verification factor if required by client:\n\n   * Common third factor: Last four digits of SSN OR account number OR verbal password (if set)  \n   * Confirm: \"Can you provide the last four digits of your Social Security number?\" OR relevant factor  \n5. Compare provided factors against system records:\n\n   * All factors match exactly: verification passes → proceed to Module 2 disclosure decision  \n   * Any factor does not match: provide one additional attempt for that factor  \n   * After THREE TOTAL FAILED ATTEMPTS across all factors: terminate interaction  \n6. If verification fails:\n\n   * Do NOT hint at correct answers (\"Your birthday is in March, not April\")  \n   * Do NOT provide partial information (\"You're close\")  \n   * Use refusal script: \"I'm unable to verify your identity using the information provided. For your security, I cannot proceed with this request over the phone. You have these alternatives: \\[list alternatives per script\\].\"  \n7. Alternatives to offer after verification failure:\n\n   * Secure callback: \"I can call you back at the phone number we have on file after you confirm that number.\"  \n   * Secure portal: \"You can access this information through our secure patient portal.\"  \n   * In-person with ID: \"You can visit our office with photo identification.\"  \n   * Written request: \"You can submit a written request with your signature.\"  \n8. Document verification outcome in system/ticket:\n\n   * Pass: \"Identity verified using \\[factors\\]. Proceeded with \\[disclosure/action\\].\"  \n   * Fail: \"Identity verification failed after \\[X\\] attempts. Interaction terminated. Offered alternatives: \\[list\\]. No disclosure occurred.\"\n\n**Procedure: Verify Provider/Payer Caller Identity**\n\n1. Request caller identification:\n\n   * Name and role/title  \n   * Organization name  \n   * Department  \n   * Callback number (official organizational number, not personal cell)  \n2. Verify identity using client-approved method (needs\\_review per client):\n\n   * Method A: Callback to verified organizational number from records  \n   * Method B: Verify caller ID matches organizational number \\+ verify personal details  \n   * Method C: Use provider/payer directory to confirm person and role  \n   * Method D: Request faxback on organizational letterhead  \n3. If verification method is unclear or caller resists: escalate to supervisor before disclosing\n\n4. Document provider/payer verification: \"Verified caller identity: \\[Name\\], \\[Role\\], \\[Organization\\]. Method: \\[callback/caller ID verification/directory confirmation\\].\"\n\n**Procedure: Handle Verification Failures (Script Discipline)**\n\n**Attempt 1 Failure:** \"Let me try that information again. Can you provide your \\[factor\\]?\" \\[If fails again, this is Attempt 2\\]\n\n**Attempt 2 Failure:** \"That information still doesn't match our records. I have one more attempt before I need to end this call for security reasons. Can you carefully provide your \\[factor\\]?\" \\[If fails again, this is Attempt 3 — terminate\\]\n\n**Attempt 3 Failure (Termination):** \"I'm unable to verify your identity with the information provided. For your security, I cannot share any information at this time. You can \\[list alternatives from script\\]. Is there anything else I can help with that doesn't require identity verification?\"\n\n\\[End call professionally. Do NOT continue discussing the account or providing hints.\\]\n\n**Safe Stop Rules:**\n\n* Stop if caller refuses to provide verification factors — cannot proceed without verification  \n* Stop if caller provides conflicting information (\"My DOB is March... no, April...\") — potential fraud indicator, escalate  \n* Stop if caller pressures you to skip verification (\"This is urgent\\!\" \"I've called before\\!\" \"Just this once\\!\") — apply Rule 4, maintain requirement  \n* Stop if verification factors are not working and you suspect system error — escalate to verify correct factors before continuing attempts\n\n**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → Privacy officer (for unusual verification issues or fraud concerns)\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* Every verification attempt outcome documented (pass or fail)  \n* Failed verification: number of attempts, alternatives offered, caller response  \n* Verification factors used (record which factors, not the actual values provided)  \n* Any fraud indicators or suspicious behavior",

To protect your privacy, I need to verify your identity. Can you state your full name?\" **Caller:** \"Sarah Lee.\" **Employee:** \"Thank you. Can you provide your date of birth?\" **Caller:** \"March 15, 1980.\" **Employee:** \"And can you provide the last four digits of your Social Security number?\" **Caller:** \"5678.\" **Employee:** \\[Checks system — all match\\] \"Thank you, I've verified your identity. Let me look up your test results.\" \\[Proceeds with disclosure per Module 2\\]\n\n**Why Compliant:** Followed script exactly, verified all required factors before proceeding, documented verification pass.\n\n**Compliant Example 2 \\- Verification Failure with Proper Termination (Source Scenario 16):** **Caller:** \"I need to schedule an appointment.\" **Employee:** \"I can help with that. To access your account, I need to verify your identity. Can you state your full name?\" **Caller:** \"John Smith.\" **Employee:** \"Thank you. Can you provide your date of birth?\" **Caller:** \"June 10, 1975.\" **Employee:** \\[Checks system — DOB shows June 10, 1985\\] \"Let me try that date of birth again. Can you provide your date of birth?\" **Caller:** \"June 10, 1975.\" **Employee:** \"That still doesn't match our records. I have one more attempt. Can you carefully provide your date of birth?\" **Caller:** \"I'm sure it's June 10, 1975.\" **Employee:** \\[Three attempts exhausted\\] \"I'm unable to verify your identity with the information provided. For your security, I cannot access your account at this time. You can visit our office with photo identification, or you can call back with the correct information. Is there anything else I can help with?\" **Caller:** \"No.\" \\[Call ends\\] **Employee:** \\[Documents: \"Verification failed after 3 DOB attempts. Interaction terminated per script. No disclosure occurred.\"\\]\n\n**Why Compliant:** Followed three-attempt limit exactly, did not hint at correct answer (did not say \"your birth year is 1985\"), terminated per script, offered alternatives, documented completely, no disclosure occurred. Source Scenario 16 directly addresses this pattern.\n\n**Non-Compliant Example:** **Caller:** \"This is ridiculous\\! I'm calling about my mother's surgery. It's scheduled for tomorrow and I need the time\\!\" **Employee:** \"Okay, let me verify your identity first—\" **Caller:** \"I don't have time for this\\! Just tell me the time\\! She's 82 years old and we need to know\\!\" **Employee:** \\[Feeling pressured\\] \"Alright, the surgery is at 7 AM. Make sure she's there by 6 AM for prep.\"\n\n**Why Non-Compliant:** Multiple violations:\n\n* Skipped identity verification entirely due to pressure (Rule 4 violation)  \n* Did not verify caller is authorized to receive mother's information (Module 2 authorization requirement)  \n* Disclosed surgery details to unverified, possibly unauthorized person  \n* Wrong-person disclosure incident  \n* Source patterns in Scenario 2 (family member without authorization) and Module 0 Rule 4 (pressure to bypass)  \n* Result: incident report required, sanctions likely, potential breach if information went to wrong person",

I need my wife Linda's mammogram results. We're married. Her DOB is May 5, 1978.\" You verify his identity as Robert Chen (DOB matches your system for an account under that name). He asks for Linda Chen's results.\n\n**Question:** What is the verification issue and what do you do?\n\n**Answer:** **Issue:** Robert verified his OWN identity, but he's asking for Linda's (someone else's) information. Verification of Robert's identity does not authorize disclosure of Linda's information. This requires authorization check per Module 2\\.\n\n**Response:** \"Mr. Chen, I've verified your identity for your own account. However, to share Linda's information with you, I need authorization from Linda. Is Linda available to speak with me to authorize this disclosure, or she can complete an authorization form allowing us to share her information with you. I'm unable to share her results without her permission.\"\n\n**If caller pressures:** \"I understand you're married, but our policy requires each patient's explicit authorization before we share their information with others, including spouses. This protects everyone's privacy.\"\n\n**Why Correct:** Distinguishes between verification (confirming who caller is) and authorization (permission to receive someone else's PHI). Source Scenario 2 directly addresses spouse request pattern.\n\n**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Various callers  \n **Learner plays:** Employee applying verification script\n\n**Simulation scored on:**\n\n* Stating verification purpose at start  \n* Following script exactly (no skipping factors)  \n* Handling failures per three-attempt protocol  \n* Not providing hints at correct answers  \n* Terminating appropriately after three failures  \n* Remaining professional under pressure  \n* Documenting outcome\n\n**Checklist: Verification Discipline**\n\n* \\[ \\] Stated verification purpose before requesting factors  \n* \\[ \\] Requested all required factors per client script  \n* \\[ \\] Did not skip factors even if caller seemed legitimate  \n* \\[ \\] Did not hint at correct answers when factors mismatched  \n* \\[ \\] Followed three-attempt limit exactly  \n* \\[ \\] Terminated interaction after third failure  \n* \\[ \\] Offered appropriate alternatives after failure  \n* \\[ \\] Remained professional during caller frustration or pressure  \n* \\[ \\] Documented verification outcome completely  \n* \\[ \\] Distinguished between identity verification and authorization to receive PHI\n\n**Scoring Rubric:**\n\n* Verification script execution: 4 points  \n* Three-attempt protocol adherence: 2 points  \n* Termination handling: 2 points  \n* Documentation: 2 points  \n* **Total: 10 points (8/10 \\= 80% passing)**",

A) 1  \n B) 2  \n C) 3  \n D) Unlimited\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Three-attempt limit is standard to balance security with honest error allowance.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — unlimited attempts create guessing attack vulnerability.\n\n**Item 3 (True/False):** If a caller becomes angry during verification, you should skip the questions to de-escalate.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Verification is mandatory regardless of caller emotion; Rule 4 applies to pressure.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — prioritizing de-escalation over security.\n\n**Item 4 (MCQ):** When a caller fails verification, you should: A) Give hints to help them remember  \n B) Provide the correct information so they can try again  \n C) Not provide hints; terminate after three attempts  \n D) Transfer to supervisor to verify\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** No hints; hints compromise security and help potential impersonators.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — \"being helpful\" compromises security.\n\n**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Caller provides correct name and DOB but wrong SSN last-four three times. What do you do? A) Proceed since 2 out of 3 factors matched  \n B) Terminate per script; offer alternatives  \n C) Ask for different SSN format  \n D) Override and proceed since caller seems legitimate\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** All required factors must match; three failures trigger termination.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — partial match is not sufficient.\n\n**Item 6 (MCQ):** \"To protect your privacy, I need to verify your identity\" is: A) Optional preamble  \n B) Required statement of verification purpose  \n C) Only needed for new patients  \n D) Only needed for sensitive information\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Stating verification purpose is required at interaction start.\n\n**Item 7 (True/False):** If you've spoken to the caller before and recognize their voice, you can skip verification.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Voice recognition is not approved verification method; script required every time.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — \"I know them\" is not verification.\n\n**Item 8 (MCQ):** After verification failure, you should offer: A) One more chance with easier questions  \n B) Alternatives (secure callback, portal, in-person, written request)  \n C) To speak to supervisor who might recognize them  \n D) To call them back without verification\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Script specifies offering alternatives after verification failure.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — no \"easier questions\" exist.\n\n**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Caller says \"I'm calling about my wife's appointment. Can you tell me the time?\" What is the first verification step? A) Verify caller's identity  \n B) Verify wife's identity  \n C) Verify caller has authorization to receive wife's information  \n D) Just provide the appointment time\n\n**Answer:** A and C (both needed)  \n **For MCQ format, best answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Caller is requesting someone else's PHI; requires both identity verification (who is caller) and authorization check (is caller authorized to receive wife's PHI per Module 2). If forced to choose one answer, authorization check (C) is the critical first failure point since caller is not the patient.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A only — verifying caller's identity is necessary but not sufficient; authorization required.\n\n**Item 10 (MCQ):** Verification factors typically include (client-specific): A) Favorite color and pet name  \n B) DOB, last-four SSN, account number  \n C) Email password  \n D) Credit card number\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** DOB, SSN last-four, account numbers are standard verification factors (needs\\_review per client).  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — these are too easily guessed or known by others.\n\n**Item 11 (True/False):** If verification fails and the caller says \"Can you just tell me if I'm close?\" you should provide guidance.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Never provide hints about correctness or proximity; compromises security.\n\n**Item 12 (Short Answer):** After three verification failures, what are three alternatives you should offer?\n\n**Answer:** (Any three of: secure callback to number on file, secure patient portal access, in-person visit with photo ID, written request with signature)\n\n**Rationale:** Standard alternatives after verification failure per script.",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Procedure: Set Up Secure Remote Workspace (Initial Setup)**\n\n1. **Select workspace location in home:**\n\n   * Private room with door preferred (not open living area)  \n   * Screen positioned facing wall (not facing window or door)  \n   * Chair positioned to see door entry (aware of people entering)  \n   * Away from windows where outsiders could view screen  \n   * Separated from family common areas if possible  \n2. **Physical security setup:**\n\n   * Install privacy filter on screen per client requirement (needs\\_review)  \n   * Verify screen angle prevents viewing from doorway  \n   * Remove or cover any reflective surfaces (mirrors, glass surfaces) that could reflect screen  \n   * Ensure door can be closed during work hours  \n   * If door cannot close: use room divider or screen to create visual barrier  \n3. **Technical security setup:**\n\n   * Verify network connection meets client requirements (needs\\_review):  \n     * Password-protected home router (change default router password)  \n     * VPN installed and functioning if required  \n     * Never use public Wi-Fi or neighbor's Wi-Fi  \n   * Enable auto-lock setting per client requirement (verify time setting, typically 5-15 minutes)  \n   * Set strong workstation password (per Module 6\\)  \n   * Test manual lock shortcut (Windows+L) for muscle memory  \n4. **Document workspace setup:**\n\n   * Take photos showing screen position, privacy filter, workspace boundaries  \n   * Submit to supervisor for approval per onboarding requirement  \n   * If workspace changes (moving to different room): repeat documentation\n\n**Procedure: Daily Secure Workspace Discipline**\n\n1. **Start of shift:**\n\n   * Close and/or lock workspace door  \n   * Notify household members you are starting work, interruptions should be minimized  \n   * Position screen at secure angle  \n   * Verify privacy filter in place (if required)  \n   * Log in to systems  \n2. **During work:**\n\n   * Manual lock before EVERY absence (bathroom, kitchen, doorbell, phone call):  \n     * Press Windows+L (or equivalent) BEFORE standing up  \n     * Verify lock screen displayed  \n     * Walk away  \n   * If family member or visitor enters unexpectedly:  \n     * Immediately mute audio if on call  \n     * Press Windows+L to lock screen  \n     * Pause work, address interruption  \n     * Verify no PHI visible on screen after lock  \n     * Resume only after interruption cleared  \n   * If interruption cannot be cleared quickly (visitor staying, family needs assistance):  \n     * Log out of systems if secure lock insufficient  \n     * Notify supervisor of extended interruption if during active call/task  \n     * Resume only when workspace secure again  \n3. **Breaks and lunch:**\n\n   * Manual lock BEFORE leaving workspace  \n   * Close door if possible  \n   * No PHI documents left visible on desk  \n   * Verify screen locked before exiting room  \n4. **End of shift:**\n\n   * Log out of all systems  \n   * Lock workstation  \n   * Clean desk: all documents secured or shredded  \n   * No sticky notes with PHI visible  \n   * Close door to workspace  \n   * Power down or lock computer per client requirement\n\n**Procedure: Handle Workspace Compromise Incident**\n\n**Compromise examples:**\n\n* Family member saw screen before you locked  \n* Visitor (delivery person, neighbor, maintenance) entered and may have viewed screen  \n* Overheard PHI during your call (family member in adjacent room)  \n* Screen visible through window to outside  \n* Document left visible when someone entered\n\n**Response steps:**\n\n1. **Stop immediately:** If currently handling PHI, stop activity  \n2. **Secure workspace:** Lock screen, secure any visible documents  \n3. **Assess exposure:** What PHI may have been visible/audible? To whom?  \n4. **Notify supervisor immediately:** Use secure communication channel (phone, secure message), describe what happened:  \n   * \"My \\[family member/visitor\\] entered workspace during \\[call/screen display\\] and may have seen \\[patient account screen/document/heard conversation\\].\"  \n   * Do NOT include patient identifiers in escalation message unless secure method  \n5. **Document incident:**  \n   * What happened, when, who may have seen/heard PHI, what PHI  \n   * Immediate actions taken (locked screen, ended call, etc.)  \n   * Follow Module 10 incident reporting procedure  \n6. **Preserve evidence if needed:** Do not delete anything  \n7. **Corrective actions:** Based on supervisor guidance, may include:  \n   * Improved physical barriers (door lock, screen repositioning)  \n   * Household re-education about workspace boundaries  \n   * Workspace relocation  \n   * Privacy filter installation if not already present\n\n**Procedure: Handle Power Outages and Connection Issues**\n\n1. **If power outage occurs during work:**\n\n   * Systems will shut down (data loss depending on application)  \n   * Notify supervisor as soon as possible after power restored  \n   * Do NOT use public Wi-Fi or mobile hotspot from public location to reconnect  \n   * Do NOT go to coffee shop or library to finish work  \n   * Wait for home power restoration or follow client emergency work stoppage procedure  \n2. **If internet connection fails:**\n\n   * Troubleshoot per IT guidance (router restart, etc.)  \n   * Notify supervisor of outage  \n   * Do NOT use alternative unsecured connection  \n   * Do NOT use neighbor's Wi-Fi or public hotspot  \n3. **Document outage:**\n\n   * Time of outage, duration, any work interruption impact\n\n**Safe Stop Rules:**\n\n* Stop if non-work person enters workspace while PHI visible — lock screen immediately  \n* Stop if you cannot maintain workspace security (household emergency, construction workers entering home) — log out, notify supervisor  \n* Stop if connection security is uncertain (network issues, VPN failure) — do not proceed until confirmed secure  \n* Stop if privacy filter missing and client requires it — do not work until installed\n\n**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → IT (for technical issues) / Compliance (for security incidents)\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* Workspace setup photos (initial and any changes)  \n* Workspace compromise incidents documented fully per Module 10  \n* Daily clean desk/clean screen compliance (verified through periodic supervisor spot checks)",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Compliant Example 1 \\- Interruption Handling (Source Scenario 4 \\- Family Member Entry):** Medical scribe is documenting provider dictation via video call. Family member (spouse) unexpectedly enters room to ask a question. Scribe immediately:\n\n1. Mutes audio  \n2. Presses Windows+L to lock screen  \n3. Turns to family member: \"I'm on a work call. Can this wait five minutes?\"  \n4. Family member leaves  \n5. Scribe verifies screen locked (PHI not visible), resumes call  \n6. Documents in end-of-shift note: \"Brief interruption, family member entered workspace, workspace secured immediately, no PHI exposure\"\n\n**Why Compliant:** Immediate containment actions (mute, lock), prioritized PHI security over social courtesy, verified security before resuming, documented incident. Source Scenario 4 directly addresses this pattern.\n\n**Compliant Example 2 \\- Power Outage Response (Source Scenario 15 Context):** Employee experiencing scheduled power outage in area (announced by utility company). Employee:\n\n1. Notifies supervisor start of shift: \"Power outage scheduled 2-4 PM today. I will be offline during that time.\"  \n2. During outage: does not attempt to continue work via alternative methods  \n3. After power restored: reconnects via secure home network \\+ VPN, resumes work  \n4. Documents: \"Power outage 2:03-3:47 PM, offline during that time, resumed via secure connection after restoration\"\n\n**Why Compliant:** Proactive notification, did not use unsecured alternatives (no public Wi-Fi, no mobile hotspot from public location), documented outage. Source Scenario 15 addresses network security discipline.\n\n**Non-Compliant Example:** Employee works in shared living space (no door). Family members frequently walk through area. Employee has call with patient discussing diagnosis. Family member overhears conversation while getting water from kitchen. Employee continues call without interruption. Family member later mentions to neighbor that employee was talking about \"someone's cancer diagnosis.\"\n\n**Why Non-Compliant:** Multiple violations:\n\n* Inadequate workspace setup (no privacy from family)  \n* Failed to stop when family member entered hearing range  \n* PHI overheard by unauthorized person  \n* No incident reporting after recognizing family heard PHI  \n* Workspace compromise incident occurred  \n* Source patterns in Module 5 workspace security principles  \n* Result: incident report required, possible workspace prohibition (may be required to work from supervised facility if home workspace cannot be secured), sanctions",

Press Windows+L to lock screen  \n4. Verify lock screen displayed (no PHI visible)  \n5. Go to door, handle delivery (keep it brief)  \n6. Return to workspace, verify door closed  \n7. Unlock screen (password entry)  \n8. Unmute call  \n9. Resume: \"Thank you for holding. Where were we?\"  \n10. Document if any unusual delay: \"Brief interruption for delivery, workspace secured per protocol\"\n\n**Why Correct:** Lock screen BEFORE absence, verify security, handle interruption briefly, resume through proper unlock.\n\n**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Supervisor conducting workspace security audit (virtual)  \n **Learner plays:** Employee demonstrating workspace\n\n**Trainer:** \"I need to verify your workspace security setup.

              "contentMarkdown": "**Item 1 (MCQ):** Before standing up from your workstation for any reason, you should: A) Tell someone where you're going  \n B) Lock workstation manually (Windows+L)  \n C) Turn off monitor  \n D) Log out of all systems\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Manual lock required before every absence, even brief ones.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — turning off monitor doesn't lock system; session remains active.\n\n**Item 2 (MCQ):** Privacy filter: A) Is optional convenience feature  \n B) Limits screen viewing angle to prevent shoulder surfing  \n C) Only needed in office settings  \n D) Replaces need for screen lock\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Privacy filter limits side/behind viewing angle for physical security.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — privacy filter supplements, does not replace, lock discipline.\n\n**Item 3 (True/False):** If a family member enters your workspace unexpectedly during a call, you should finish your sentence before securing the workspace.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Immediate containment required (mute, lock) when non-work person enters.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — prioritizing conversation flow over security.\n\n**Item 4 (MCQ):** Public Wi-Fi use for client work is: A) Allowed if using VPN  \n B) Allowed if no PHI visible  \n C) Allowed in emergencies  \n D) Absolutely prohibited\n\n**Answer:** D  \n **Rationale:** Public Wi-Fi prohibited regardless of VPN or content; security risk too high.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — VPN does not make public Wi-Fi acceptable.\n\n**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Power outage at your home during work hours. What do you do? A) Go to coffee shop to continue work  \n B) Use mobile hotspot from library  \n C) Notify supervisor, wait for home power restoration  \n D) Use neighbor's Wi-Fi temporarily\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** No alternative unsecured connections allowed; wait for secure home connection restoration.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — coffee shop Wi-Fi is public and prohibited.\n\n**Item 6 (MCQ):** Clean desk at end of shift means: A) Tidy appearance  \n B) No PHI visible; all documents secured or shredded  \n C) Monitor off  \n D) Keyboard covered\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Clean desk \\= no PHI visible on physical workspace.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — \"tidy\" is not the security requirement; PHI removal is.\n\n**Item 7 (True/False):** Auto-lock setting eliminates the need for manual locking before absences.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Manual lock required before every absence; auto-lock is backup for forgotten manual locks.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — relying solely on auto-lock leaves exposure during absence before timer triggers.\n\n**Item 8 (MCQ):** If you realize a family member saw your screen before you locked it, you should: A) Do nothing if they didn't say anything  \n B) Immediately report as workspace compromise incident  \n C) Only report if they saw sensitive diagnoses  \n D) Ask them not to tell anyone\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Any potential PHI exposure is reportable incident, regardless of content type or outcome.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — \"didn't say anything\" doesn't eliminate incident reporting requirement.\n\n**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Your screen position faces a window where neighbors could potentially see if looking. What do you do? A) Keep working; unlikely anyone is looking  \n B) Reposition screen immediately to face wall, not window  \n C) Close blinds and continue  \n D) Only worry about it during daytime\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Screen must be positioned to prevent any external viewing possibility; repositioning is required.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — blinds can open or be imperfect; positioning is primary control.\n\n**Item 10 (MCQ):** Workspace compromise incident requires: A) Stop work, secure workspace, notify supervisor immediately, document  \n B) Continue working and mention at end of shift  \n C) Only report if patient complains  \n D) Report only if you're certain PHI was seen\n\n**Answer:** A  \n **Rationale:** Immediate response required: stop, secure, escalate, document.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — report potential exposure, not just confirmed exposure.\n\n**Item 11 (True/False):** If your home internet is down, you can use your phone's mobile hotspot to continue work.\n\n**Answer:** False (needs clarification based on client policy)  \n **Rationale:** Generally prohibited; mobile hotspots may not meet security requirements (needs\\_review per client). If client explicitly allows secure mobile hotspots, answer may differ, but default is prohibition of alternative connections.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — assuming mobile hotspot is acceptable alternative.\n\n**Item 12 (MCQ):** Manual lock keyboard shortcut (Windows) is: A) Ctrl+Alt+Del  \n B) Windows+L  \n C) Alt+F4  \n D) Ctrl+L\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Windows+L is standard Windows lock shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+Del also accesses lock option but requires additional click).  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — Ctrl+Alt+Del brings up security options menu, not immediate lock.\n\n**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** You work in a room with a door. Your spouse knocks and opens door during your call. What do you do FIRST? A) Tell spouse to wait  \n B) Mute call and lock screen (Windows+L) immediately  \n C) Cover screen with paper  \n D) End call\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Immediate containment (mute \\+ lock) is first action, before addressing person.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — securing workspace takes priority over social response.\n\n**Item 14 (Short Answer):** List three physical security elements required for secure home workspace setup.\n\n**Answer:** (Any three of: screen positioned away from window/door, privacy filter installed if required, door that closes or visual barrier, no reflective surfaces showing screen, separation from family common areas)\n\n**Rationale:** Physical controls prevent unauthorized viewing.\n\n**Item 15 (MCQ):** Clean screen means: A) Dust-free monitor  \n B) No PHI visible on display (locked or closed)  \n C) Screen protector installed  \n D) Brightness adjusted\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Clean screen \\= no PHI visible, achieved through locking or closing applications.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — physical cleanliness is not the security definition.",

Password rotation cadence and exact controls need\\_review against current standard and client IAM because NIST 800-63B guidance has evolved.\n\n**Observable Behaviors:**\n\n* Creates passwords meeting client-specific complexity requirements  \n* Enrolls MFA during onboarding and maintains enrollment  \n* Never shares credentials (username, password, MFA codes) with anyone  \n* Respects session timeouts; re-authenticates without complaint  \n* Uses password manager only if client-approved (needs\\_review)  \n* Reports suspected account compromise immediately (unusual login alerts, forgotten logins, suspicious activity)",

Absolutely prohibited; results in immediate termination under acceleration clause.\n\n**Session Timeout:** Automatic logout after period of inactivity (typically 15-30 minutes, needs\\_review per client). Requires re-authentication to resume work.\n\n**Password Manager (needs\\_review):** Software storing encrypted passwords; reduces need to memorize multiple complex passwords. Client approval required before use; some clients prohibit, others require specific approved tools.\n\n**Password Complexity Requirements (needs\\_review):** Client-specific rules for password creation (length, character types, prohibited patterns). Common requirements: 12+ characters, mix of uppercase/lowercase/numbers/symbols, no dictionary words, no personal information. Exact requirements need\\_review per client IAM policy.\n\n**Password Rotation/Expiration (needs\\_review):** Frequency of required password changes. NIST 800-63B current guidance discourages mandatory periodic rotation without cause; however, client policies vary and may require rotation (30-90 days common historically).

              "contentMarkdown": "**Procedure: Enroll MFA During Onboarding**\n\n1. Receive MFA enrollment instructions from IT during onboarding\n\n2. Identify client-approved MFA method (needs\\_review per client; common methods: authenticator app, SMS codes, hardware token, biometric)\n\n3. Follow enrollment steps for approved method:\n\n    **For Authenticator App (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator):**\n\n   * Install approved authenticator app on personal phone  \n   * Scan QR code displayed during enrollment  \n   * Enter verification code generated by app to confirm enrollment  \n   * Note: phone must be accessible during every login  \n4. **For SMS Codes:**\n\n   * Provide verified phone number  \n   * Receive test code via SMS  \n   * Enter code to confirm enrollment  \n   * Update phone number immediately if it changes  \n5. **For Hardware Token:**\n\n   * Receive physical token from IT  \n   * Test token code entry during enrollment  \n   * Store token securely; bring to work daily  \n6. Generate and securely store backup codes:\n\n   * System generates 10-12 backup codes during enrollment  \n   * Print backup codes OR write down and store in secure location (NOT on device, NOT in email)  \n   * Each backup code works once only  \n   * Recommended: store in home safe or locked drawer, separate from device  \n7. Verify MFA enrollment successful:\n\n   * Log out completely  \n   * Log back in using password \\+ MFA method  \n   * If successful: enrollment complete  \n   * If unsuccessful: contact IT immediately for troubleshooting  \n8. Document MFA enrollment completion in training record\n\n**Procedure: Daily Authentication Discipline**\n\n1. **Login at start of shift:**\n\n   * Enter username  \n   * Enter password (do not save password in browser unless client-approved password manager policy permits)  \n   * Complete MFA prompt (enter code from app, SMS, or token)  \n   * Verify successful login to all required systems  \n2. **During work session:**\n\n   * Do not walk away leaving session unlocked (manual lock per Module 5\\)  \n   * If session timeout occurs during work:  \n     * Save work if possible before timeout  \n     * Re-authenticate through login screen  \n     * Resume work  \n   * Do NOT attempt to bypass or extend session timeout  \n   * Do NOT share screen while password visible during login  \n3. **End of shift:**\n\n   * Log out of all systems manually (do not rely on auto-logout)  \n   * Confirm logout completed before closing applications\n\n**Procedure: Handle Credential Sharing Requests (Always Refuse)**\n\n**Scenario A: Colleague asks to borrow login** Response: \"I cannot share my credentials. That violates our security policy and puts both of us at risk. If you need system access, please contact IT for your own credentials \\[or password reset\\].\"\n\n**Scenario B: Supervisor asks for password \"just this once\"** Response: \"I need to follow our credential policy and cannot share my password. Can I help you with the task directly, or we can escalate to IT for proper access?\" If supervisor insists: \"I need to escalate this request to \\[compliance/HR\\] to confirm this is an approved exception.\" \\[Then escalate immediately per safe stop Rule 4\\]\n\n**Scenario C: Colleague's account locked, asks to use yours to meet deadline** Response: \"I can't share my credentials. Let me help you contact IT for an emergency unlock. Usually takes 10-15 minutes.\" Do NOT offer your login as temporary solution.\n\n**Scenario D: IT or supervisor requests password over phone/email** Response: \"Our policy is that I never provide my password to anyone, including IT or supervisors. Can you verify this is a legitimate request through \\[proper IT ticket channel/official company directory\\]?\" Legitimate IT never asks for your password; if request persists, escalate to security/compliance.\n\n**Procedure: Respond to Suspected Account Compromise**\n\n**Warning signs of compromise:**\n\n* Login alert from unfamiliar location/device  \n* System shows active session you don't recognize  \n* Password no longer works (changed without your action)  \n* Unusual activity in your account history (emails sent, files accessed)  \n* MFA codes requested that you didn't initiate\n\n**Response steps:**\n\n1. **Stop work immediately**  \n2. **Change password immediately** if you can still log in:  \n   * Use password reset process  \n   * Create completely new password (do not reuse old password with minor changes)  \n   * Verify MFA still enrolled correctly  \n3. **If you cannot log in** (password changed by attacker):  \n   * Contact IT immediately for emergency password reset  \n   * Do NOT attempt multiple failed login attempts  \n4. **Report to supervisor immediately:** \"I suspect my account may be compromised. I've changed my password \\[or cannot log in\\]. Please log this as a security incident.\"  \n5. **Document incident:**  \n   * What you observed (login alert, failed password, unusual activity)  \n   * When you first noticed  \n   * Actions taken (password changed, IT contacted)  \n   * Follow Module 10 incident reporting procedure  \n6. **Cooperate with investigation:**  \n   * IT may review login history  \n   * May require additional authentication steps  \n   * Do not delete any suspicious emails or activity evidence\n\n**Safe Stop Rules:**\n\n* Stop if anyone asks for your password — never provide, escalate  \n* Stop if session timeout frustrates you — do not seek bypass; re-authenticate properly  \n* Stop if MFA enrollment fails — contact IT before attempting workarounds  \n* Stop if you suspect account compromise — change password, escalate immediately\n\n**Escalation Path:** IT helpdesk → IT security → Compliance (for credential sharing or compromise incidents)\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* MFA enrollment verification recorded in training record  \n* Credential sharing refusals documented if pressure occurred (incident report per Module 10\\)  \n* Account compromise incidents documented fully (Module 10 procedure)",

Training record updated with MFA enrollment verification timestamp\n\n**Why Compliant:** Completed enrollment per instructions, stored backup codes securely (not on device), verified enrollment functionality, documented completion.\n\n**Compliant Example 2 \\- Credential Sharing Refusal (Source Scenario 13):** Colleague urgently requests: \"My account is locked and I need to process this claim today. Can I use your login for 10 minutes? I'll log you out when done.\"\n\nEmployee response: \"I can't share my credentials — that's against our policy and could get us both terminated. Let me help you contact IT for an emergency unlock. Usually takes about 15 minutes. Do you have IT's number?\"\n\nColleague: \"This is urgent\\!

Source Scenario 13 directly addresses credential sharing pressure pattern.\n\n**Non-Compliant Example:** Supervisor to employee: \"I need to review some accounts and my login isn't working. What's your password? I'll just use yours quickly.\"\n\nEmployee: \"Okay, it's MyP@ssw0rd123. Log out when done.\"\n\nTwo days later: Audit discovers supervisor accessed accounts outside their authorization using employee's credentials. Investigation traces unauthorized access to employee's account. Both supervisor and employee terminated under acceleration clause (supervisor for unauthorized access \\+ credential misuse; employee for credential sharing).\n\n**Why Non-Compliant:** Credential sharing is absolute prohibition with immediate termination consequence, even when requested by supervisor. Employee should have refused and helped supervisor contact IT for proper access or password reset. Source Scenario 13 and Module 6 explicitly prohibit credential sharing under any circumstance.

What do you do? A) Try to bypass timeout using browser back button  \n B) Re-authenticate through login screen and resume  \n C) Contact IT to extend timeout setting  \n D) Use colleague's session on their computer\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Respect timeout; re-authenticate properly and resume work.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — attempting bypass violates session management controls.\n\n**Item 6 (MCQ):** Warning signs of account compromise include: A) Slow system performance  \n B) Login alert from unfamiliar location, password no longer works  \n C) Too many emails in inbox  \n D) Scheduled maintenance notice\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Unexpected login activity or password change indicates potential compromise.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — slow performance usually not compromise indicator.\n\n**Item 7 (True/False):** Password managers are always allowed for storing work passwords.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Password manager use requires client approval (needs\\_review per client); some prohibit, others require specific tools.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — assuming password managers are universally acceptable.\n\n**Item 8 (MCQ):** If you suspect account compromise, you should: A) Wait to see if it happens again  \n B) Immediately change password, report to IT and supervisor  \n C) Just change password quietly  \n D) Monitor the situation for a few days\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Immediate response required: change password, escalate to IT and supervisor, document.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — reporting required, not just password change.\n\n**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Supervisor orders: \"Give me your password. That's a direct order.\" What do you do? A) Comply since it's a direct order  \n B) Refuse and escalate to compliance/HR immediately  \n C) Give password but document it  \n D) Negotiate a compromise\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Credential sharing prohibited even by supervisor order; escalate immediately.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — orders do not override security policy.\n\n**Item 10 (MCQ):** Session timeout exists to: A) Annoy users  \n B) Prevent unauthorized access to abandoned sessions  \n C) Save system resources  \n D) Force password changes\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Session timeout security control prevents access if user forgets to log out or lock.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — resource saving is minor benefit, not primary purpose.\n\n**Item 11 (True/False):** Legitimate IT staff will sometimes ask for your password over phone or email to troubleshoot issues.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** IT never needs your password; they can reset it but should never ask for it.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — not understanding that IT has administrative access and doesn't need user passwords.\n\n**Item 12 (MCQ):** After MFA enrollment, you should: A) Delete backup codes since you have the app  \n B) Share backup codes with supervisor for safety  \n C) Store backup codes securely separate from device  \n D) Email backup codes to yourself\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** Backup codes must be physically secure and separate from primary MFA device.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — backup codes needed if primary MFA method fails.\n\n**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** You receive email: \"Your password expires in 24 hours. Click here to reset.\" What do you do? A) Click link and reset password  \n B) Suspect phishing; do not click; verify through official IT channel or login portal directly  \n C) Reply asking if email is legitimate  \n D) Forward to colleague to check\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Password reset phishing common; verify through official channels, never click links in unexpected emails.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — clicking link without verification is phishing vulnerability.\n\n**Item 14 (Short Answer):** What are the three types of authentication factors in MFA?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1.

              "contentMarkdown": "**Procedure: Compose PHI-Safe Email**\n\n1. **Before starting email:**\n\n   * Confirm purpose: what specific information does recipient need?  \n   * Confirm recipient: who exactly needs this information and why?  \n   * Confirm channel: is email approved for this recipient and content type? (needs\\_review per client)  \n2. **Subject line discipline:**\n\n   * Access subject line library job aid (approved generic subjects)  \n   * Select appropriate generic subject from library:  \n     * \"Claim follow-up\" NOT \"John Doe's cancer treatment claim\"  \n     * \"Benefits question\" NOT \"Sarah Lee diabetes coverage\"  \n     * \"Authorization update\" NOT \"MRI authorization for patient \\#123456\"  \n     * \"Account inquiry\" NOT \"Payment question for Mary Johnson DOB 3/15/80\"  \n   * If no appropriate generic subject exists: create one without PHI and submit to supervisor for approval to add to library  \n   * NEVER include patient name, MRN, diagnosis, account details, or any identifier in subject line  \n3. **Recipient verification checklist (critical step):**\n\n   * Type first few letters of recipient name/email  \n   * STOP and carefully review auto-complete suggestions  \n   * Verify correct recipient selected (check full email address, not just name display)  \n   * Verify email domain matches expected organization (e.g., @clientorg.com NOT @gmail.com)  \n   * For external recipients: verify organization is appropriate recipient for this PHI  \n   * Check To vs CC vs BCC:  \n     * To: Primary recipients who need to act  \n     * CC: Recipients who need awareness (verify each has need-to-know)  \n     * BCC: Rarely used; verify policy allows BCC for intended purpose  \n   * If reply-all button clicked: verify all recipients have need-to-know for your response content  \n4. **Compose body with minimum necessary:**\n\n   * Start with greeting  \n   * State purpose clearly  \n   * Include only minimum necessary PHI:  \n     * Use account number or MRN (needed for record identification)  \n     * Avoid patient name if identifier already provided  \n     * Avoid diagnosis or clinical details unless essential for stated purpose  \n     * Use generic descriptions: \"patient contacted regarding outstanding balance\" NOT \"patient with diabetes called about unpaid insulin claim\"  \n   * Provide next steps or required actions  \n   * Professional closing  \n5. **Attachment discipline:**\n\n   * Attach only files recipient needs (not entire folder)  \n   * Verify attachments contain only minimum necessary PHI  \n   * Check file names: avoid PHI in file name itself (\"Account\\_789\\_statement.pdf\" NOT \"John\\_Doe\\_medical\\_bill.pdf\")  \n   * If client requires: encrypt attachments or use password protection (needs\\_review)  \n6. **Thread history review (before forward or reply):**\n\n   * Scroll down and read entire thread history  \n   * Identify PHI in previous messages  \n   * Assess: Does new recipient need to see that historical PHI?  \n   * If no: copy only relevant text to new email (do not forward full thread)  \n   * If yes and historical PHI is excessive: redact unnecessary PHI from thread before forwarding  \n7. **Final verification before sending:**\n\n   * Re-read recipient email addresses (all To/CC/BCC)  \n   * Re-read subject line (PHI-free?)  \n   * Re-read body (minimum necessary?)  \n   * Verify attachments correct  \n   * Click Send  \n8. **If error realized after sending:**\n\n   * Attempt recall if client system supports (Outlook recall feature)  \n   * Immediately escalate to supervisor: \"I sent email with PHI to wrong recipient. Attempting recall. Please log incident.\"  \n   * Follow Module 10 incident response procedure  \n   * Do NOT delete sent email (preserve evidence)\n\n**Procedure: Select Approved Communication Channel**\n\n**Decision tree for channel selection:**\n\n1. **Identify recipient type:**\n\n   * Internal colleague (client employee): Client email system typically approved  \n   * External provider: Secure provider portal, encrypted email, or secure fax (needs\\_review per client)  \n   * Payer: Secure payer portal, encrypted email, or secure fax (needs\\_review per client)  \n   * Patient: Secure patient portal, encrypted email (if patient enrolled), phone for discussion (with verification), postal mail  \n   * Other: Escalate for guidance  \n2. **For each recipient type, verify channel approval:**\n\n   * Check approved channel list for client (needs\\_review job aid)  \n   * If channel not on approved list: STOP, do not use, escalate for approval or alternative  \n3. **Common scenarios:**\n\n   * \"Can I text patient appointment reminder?\" → NO if text includes PHI; YES if generic reminder only (\"You have appointment tomorrow at 2 PM\" acceptable if no diagnosis/provider name; \"Your diabetes appointment with Dr. Smith\" is PHI)  \n   * \"Can I email provider using their Gmail?\" → Generally NO; use official provider portal or secure email to provider's professional email  \n   * \"Can I use WhatsApp to send colleague a patient question?\" → NO; use client email system or approved internal messaging  \n   * \"Can I discuss patient information on Slack?\" → Only if Slack is client-approved platform for internal communication (needs\\_review per client)  \n4. **If uncertain about channel approval:**\n\n   * STOP (safe stop Rule 2\\)  \n   * Escalate to supervisor: \"I need to communicate \\[type of information\\] to \\[recipient type\\]. Is \\[proposed channel\\] approved?\"  \n   * Wait for confirmation before proceeding  \n   * Do NOT assume channel is acceptable because it's convenient or commonly used\n\n**Safe Stop Rules:**\n\n* Stop if subject line contains patient identifiers or diagnosis — rewrite with generic subject  \n* Stop if recipient auto-complete shows multiple similar options — carefully verify correct recipient  \n* Stop if uncertain whether channel is approved — escalate before sending  \n* Stop if you notice PHI in thread history before forwarding — redact or copy text to new email\n\n**Escalation Path:** Supervisor → IT (for technical channel questions) / Privacy officer (for policy interpretation)\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* PHI-containing emails automatically logged by system (audit trail)  \n* Wrong recipient incidents documented immediately per Module 10  \n* Channel approval questions documented in escalation ticket",

Authorization needed for outpatient procedure scheduled 12/20. Please verify coverage and notify if pre-authorization required.\n\nLet me know if you need additional information.\n\nThanks, \\[Your Name\\]\"\n\n**Why Compliant:** Generic subject (no PHI), verified recipient, minimum necessary body (account number only, no patient name or diagnosis), clear purpose, professional.\n\n**Compliant Example 2 \\- Email Rewrite Removing PHI:** **Original (non-compliant):** **Subject:** John Doe cancer treatment  \n **Body:** \"John Doe, DOB 3/15/70, MRN 123456, diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer, needs authorization for chemotherapy starting next week.\"\n\n**Rewritten (compliant):** **Subject:** Authorization request  \n **Body:** \"Authorization requested for account MRN 123456\\. Treatment start date scheduled for next week. Please confirm authorization status.\"\n\n**Why Improved:** Subject now generic, removed patient name (MRN sufficient), removed diagnosis details (not needed if payer has MRN for lookup), still provides necessary information (MRN, timeline).\n\n**Non-Compliant Example (Source Scenario 7 and Related Patterns):** **Situation:** Employee intends to email benefits coordinator Sarah.Johnson@clientorg.com. Types \"Sarah\" in recipient field. Auto-complete suggests:\n\n* Sarah.Johnson@clientorg.com (correct)  \n* Sarah.Jones@clientorg.com (different person, similar name)  \n* Sarah\\_Johnson@gmail.com (personal email)\n\nEmployee quickly clicks first auto-complete suggestion without verifying. Accidentally selects Sarah.Jones@clientorg.com. Email contains patient account details (MRN, name, diagnosis, claim information). Sends email.\n\nOne hour later, Sarah Jones (wrong recipient) replies: \"I think you meant to send this to Sarah Johnson, not me. I don't work in benefits.\"\n\n**Why Non-Compliant:** Failed recipient verification step, disclosed PHI to wrong internal person (no need-to-know). Source Scenario 7 addresses misdirected email pattern.\n\n**Immediate response:**\n\n1. Reply to Sarah Jones: \"Please delete that email and do not forward. I've escalated this incident to my supervisor.\"  \n2. Escalate to supervisor immediately: \"I sent PHI email to wrong Sarah. Sarah Jones received instead of Sarah Johnson. Wrong Sarah has no need-to-know. She has been asked to delete. Please log incident.\"  \n3. Follow Module 10 incident procedure  \n4. Document carefully: auto-complete error, immediate discovery, containment attempted, escalated\n\n**Result:** Incident documented, training refresher likely required on recipient verification, potential counseling depending on history.

You reply with status. Before sending, you notice thread history includes 5 previous emails discussing patient's diagnosis, treatment plan, and personal family situation (prior medical history questions). Does new recipient (provider) need all that thread history?\n\n**Question:** What do you do?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. Assess: Provider asking about authorization status (needs authorization answer only, not medical history or personal details from thread)  \n2. Do NOT forward full thread with reply  \n3. Create new email:  \n   * To: \\[Provider email, verified\\]  \n   * Subject: Authorization status \\- Account 789  \n   * Body: \"Authorization approved for account 789\\. Valid dates: \\[dates\\]. Please let me know if you need additional information.\"  \n4. Send new email WITHOUT thread history  \n5. If provider needs historical context: they can request specific information, which you provide on minimum necessary basis\n\n**Why Correct:** Removes unnecessary PHI from thread history, provides only what provider needs for current inquiry (authorization status), applies minimum necessary to historical emails.\n\n**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** QA reviewer checking sent emails  \n **Learner plays:** Employee explaining email decisions\n\n**Trainer:** \"I'm reviewing your sent emails from last week. This email has subject 'Patient account question.' Can you walk me through your subject line choice?\"\n\n**Learner expected actions:**\n\n* Explain: \"I used generic subject from approved library because the original question involved patient account details.

A) \"John Doe's test results\"  \n B) \"Claim status update\"  \n C) \"Patient \\#123 diabetes medication\"  \n D) \"Sarah Lee MRN 456789\"\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Generic subject without identifiers or diagnosis.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — includes diagnosis.\n\n**Item 2 (MCQ):** Banned channels for PHI include: A) Client email system  \n B) SMS, WhatsApp, personal email  \n C) Secure patient portal  \n D) Encrypted email\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** SMS, WhatsApp, personal email prohibited for PHI per source banned list.\n\n**Item 3 (True/False):** If WhatsApp is encrypted, it's acceptable to send patient information via WhatsApp.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** WhatsApp is banned channel regardless of encryption.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — assuming encryption makes channel acceptable.\n\n**Item 4 (MCQ):** Before clicking Send on email with PHI, you must: A) Just click Send quickly  \n B) Verify recipient email address, subject PHI-free, body minimum necessary, attachments correct  \n C) Only check subject line  \n D) Get supervisor approval\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Final verification checklist required before sending.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — \"quickly\" bypasses verification.\n\n**Item 5 (Scenario MCQ):** Auto-complete suggests two Sarah Johnsons with similar emails. What do you do? A) Pick the first one  \n B) Carefully verify full email address matches intended recipient  \n C) Send to both to be safe  \n D) Use different communication method\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Careful verification prevents auto-complete errors.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — picking first without verification is common error pattern (Source Scenario 7).\n\n**Item 6 (MCQ):** Thread history should be reviewed before: A) Every email  \n B) Only forward or reply  \n C) Only external emails  \n D) Never necessary\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Thread history may contain PHI that new recipient doesn't need; review before forwarding/replying.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — thread history exposure is common incident cause.\n\n**Item 7 (True/False):** You can put patient diagnosis in email subject line if the email is only going to internal staff.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Subject line should never contain PHI regardless of recipient; maintains consistency and prevents accidental external sends.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — \"internal only\" does not excuse PHI in subject.\n\n**Item 8 (MCQ):** If you realize you sent email to wrong recipient after clicking Send, you should: A) Delete the sent email  \n B) Attempt recall, immediately escalate to supervisor, follow Module 10 incident procedure  \n C) Send follow-up asking recipient to ignore  \n D) Do nothing and hope they don't read it\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Immediate incident response: recall attempt, escalation, documentation, evidence preservation.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — deleting sent email destroys evidence.\n\n**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Patient texts you: \"What were my test results?\" You should: A) Text back the results  \n B) Text back: \"Results are normal\"  \n C) Not respond via text; call patient or direct to secure portal  \n D) Text back: \"Call us\"\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** SMS prohibited for PHI; use approved channel (phone with verification or secure portal).  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** B — even \"normal\" is PHI (health information); text remains inappropriate channel.\n\n**Item 10 (MCQ):** Approved subject line library exists to: A) Save time  \n B) Provide PHI-safe generic subjects to prevent identifiers in subject lines  \n C) Standardize formatting  \n D) Satisfy IT requirements\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Library provides pre-approved PHI-free subjects to prevent identifier exposure.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — purpose is security, not just efficiency.\n\n**Item 11 (True/False):** If you're uncertain whether a communication channel is approved for PHI, you should try it once to test and see if it gets flagged.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Safe stop Rule 2: stop if channel approval uncertain, escalate before using.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — \"testing\" creates potential incident.\n\n**Item 12 (MCQ):** Minimum necessary in email body means: A) Use smallest font  \n B) Include only PHI recipient needs for stated purpose  \n C) Never use patient names  \n D) Keep emails under 100 words\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Minimum necessary \\= only what's needed for recipient's purpose.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — patient names may be necessary depending on purpose and recipient.\n\n**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** You forward email thread to colleague. Thread contains 10 previous emails discussing patient's medical history. Colleague only needs current status. What should you have done? A) Forward full thread for complete context  \n B) Copy only relevant current status to new email, exclude historical PHI  \n C) Summarize entire thread in new email  \n D) Forward and mark as confidential\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Minimum necessary: provide only current status needed, not full historical thread.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — \"complete context\" violates minimum necessary if not all needed.\n\n**Item 14 (Short Answer):** List three banned channels for PHI.\n\n**Answer:** (Any three from source list: SMS/text, WhatsApp, personal email Gmail/Yahoo/Hotmail, Facebook Messenger, Twitter/X, Instagram, LinkedIn messaging, Telegram, Signal, unapproved Slack, unapproved chat apps)\n\n**Rationale:** Source provides explicit banned channel list.\n\n**Item 15 (MCQ):** Reply-all button should: A) Always be used for transparency  \n B) Be used carefully after verifying all recipients need your response content  \n C) Never be used  \n D) Only be used for urgent messages\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Reply-all requires verification that all recipients have need-to-know for your content.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — \"transparency\" doesn't override need-to-know requirement.",

Most successful attacks exploit human trust and urgency rather than technical vulnerabilities.\n\n**Observable Behaviors:**\n\n* Inspects every email using 12-point checklist before clicking links or opening attachments  \n* Hovers over links to preview actual destination URL before clicking  \n* Verifies sender domain exactly matches expected organization  \n* Recognizes urgency/threat language as manipulation tactic  \n* Reports suspicious items via official reporting channel immediately  \n* Never clicks \"just to see\" or forwards suspicious items to colleagues  \n* Applies phone-based social engineering verification (uses approved verification method from Module 4, never discloses PHI to unverified caller)",

Common tactics: spoofed sender, urgent tone, requests for credentials/financial info, malicious links/attachments.\n\n**Spear Phishing:** Targeted phishing attack customized for specific individual or organization using researched details (your name, role, recent projects, colleagues' names) to appear more legitimate.\n\n**Social Engineering:** Psychological manipulation to bypass security controls; exploits trust, authority, urgency, helpfulness, or fear. Occurs via phone, email, in-person, or combination. Examples: impersonating IT requesting password, fake \"supervisor\" demanding urgent access, \"vendor\" requesting confidential information.\n\n**CEO Fraud (Business Email Compromise):** Phishing pattern impersonating executive or authority figure making urgent request (wire transfer, credential disclosure, policy exception). Source identifies this as common pattern in healthcare remote work environments.\n\n**Look-Alike Domain:** Domain name similar to legitimate organization but with subtle differences designed to deceive (examples: microsof**t**.com vs microsof**1**.com; clientname.com vs clientname-secure.com vs client-name.com). One character difference or added words/hyphens.\n\n**Link Hover:** Previewing actual link destination URL by hovering mouse over hyperlink without clicking; reveals whether displayed text matches actual destination.\n\n**Malware:** Malicious software (viruses, ransomware, spyware, trojans) designed to damage systems, steal data, or enable unauthorized access. Often delivered via email attachments or malicious links.\n\n**Attachment Caution:** Scrutiny of unexpected attachments, especially executable files (.exe, .bat, .scr), Office documents with macros (.docm, .xlsm), compressed files (.zip, .rar), and files from unknown senders.\n\n**Urgency/Threat Language:** Manipulation tactic using time pressure or fear (\"Account will close in 24 hours\\!\" \"Click immediately or lose access\\!\" \"Verify now to avoid suspension\\!\"). Designed to bypass rational evaluation and trigger impulsive action.",

              "contentMarkdown": "**Procedure: Email Inspection Routine (12-Point Checklist \\- Job Aid)**\n\nPerform this inspection for EVERY email before clicking links, opening attachments, or responding with sensitive information:\n\n**1\\. Sender Address Exact-Match Check:**\n\n* Click on sender name to reveal full email address  \n* Verify domain EXACTLY matches expected organization  \n* Example: legitimate \\= support@microsoft.com; phishing \\= support@micros0ft.com (zero instead of O)  \n* If sender domain unexpected or unfamiliar: STOP, proceed to point 2\n\n**2\\. Domain Look-Alike Check:**\n\n* Compare sender domain character-by-character with known legitimate domain  \n* Watch for: single character substitutions (rn appearing as m, 0 vs O, 1 vs l), added words (microsoft-support.com), added hyphens (micro-soft.com), different TLDs (microsoft.net vs microsoft.com)  \n* If ANY doubt about domain authenticity: STOP, report as suspicious\n\n**3\\. Greeting and Personalization:**\n\n* Legitimate business emails typically use your name  \n* Generic greetings (\"Dear Customer,\" \"Dear User,\" \"Hello,\") may indicate mass phishing  \n* Lack of personalization alone insufficient to determine phishing, but increases suspicion\n\n**4\\. Subject Line and Body Tone:**\n\n* Urgent language: \"Immediate action required\\!\" \"Your account will be suspended\\!\"  \n* Threat language: \"You will lose access,\" \"Final notice,\" \"Legal action\"  \n* Too-good-to-be-true: \"You've won,\" \"Unclaimed refund,\" \"Free gift\"  \n* If tone creates pressure to act quickly: STOP, slow down, apply full checklist\n\n**5\\. Spelling and Grammar:**\n\n* Professional organizations proofread; numerous errors suggest phishing  \n* Watch for: obvious typos, awkward phrasing, inconsistent formatting  \n* Note: some sophisticated phishing is well-written; absence of errors doesn't guarantee legitimacy\n\n**6\\. Link Hover and Destination Check:**\n\n* Hover mouse over ANY link without clicking  \n* Read actual destination URL in browser status bar or tooltip  \n* Verify destination domain matches displayed text and expected organization  \n* Example: Link text says \"microsoft.com\" but hover shows \"malicioussite.ru\" \\= PHISHING  \n* If link destination doesn't match expectation or text: DO NOT CLICK\n\n**7\\. Attachment Caution:**\n\n* Were you expecting this attachment?  \n* Do you know the sender personally and did they tell you they were sending this?  \n* File type: Executables (.exe, .bat, .scr, .com), macro-enabled Office docs (.docm, .xlsm), compressed files (.zip, .rar, .7z) are high-risk  \n* File name: Does file name make sense for the purported purpose?  \n* If unexpected attachment from unknown or suspicious sender: DO NOT OPEN, report\n\n**8\\. Requests for Credentials or Sensitive Information:**\n\n* Legitimate IT never asks for passwords via email  \n* Legitimate organizations never request SSN, credit card, account credentials via unsolicited email  \n* Any email requesting login credentials, password, financial information, or personal data: STOP, verify through separate trusted channel (call official number, not number in email)\n\n**9\\. Sense of Urgency or Pressure:**\n\n* \"Act now\\!\" \"Within 24 hours\\!\" \"Immediately\\!\" \"Before it's too late\\!\"  \n* Urgency is manipulation tactic designed to prevent careful evaluation  \n* If feeling rushed: STOP, slow down, apply all checklist points, consult supervisor if needed\n\n**10\\. Sender Legitimacy Verification:**\n\n* Can you verify sender through separate channel?  \n* For internal colleagues: confirm via phone, secure chat, or in-person  \n* For external organizations: call official published number (not number in suspicious email), ask if they sent communication  \n* If cannot verify: treat as suspicious\n\n**11\\. Context and Expectation:**\n\n* Does this email make sense in context of your work?  \n* Were you expecting communication from this sender about this topic?  \n* Does request align with sender's normal role and communication patterns?  \n* If out-of-context or unexpected: increase suspicion level\n\n**12\\. \"Too Good to Refuse\" or \"Too Bad to Ignore\":**\n\n* Offers that seem extraordinarily beneficial (free money, prizes, unusual benefits)  \n* Threats that seem catastrophic (account closure, legal action, data loss)  \n* Both extremes are manipulation tactics  \n* If email is at either extreme: HIGH suspicion, report\n\n**Inspection Decision After Checklist:**\n\n* **SAFE:** All checklist points pass, sender verified, context appropriate → Proceed with caution  \n* **SUSPICIOUS:** One or more red flags → DO NOT CLICK/OPEN; report immediately  \n* **UNCERTAIN:** Cannot definitively determine → Report to IT/security for evaluation\n\n**Procedure: Report Suspicious Items (Never Forward to Colleagues)**\n\n1. **Do NOT:**\n\n   * Click any links in suspicious email to \"see where it goes\"  \n   * Open any attachments to \"check if it's safe\"  \n   * Forward to colleagues asking \"Is this legitimate?\" (spreads phishing to more people)  \n   * Reply to sender asking if email is legitimate (confirms active email address to attacker)  \n   * Delete immediately without reporting (prevents security team analysis)  \n2. **Do:**\n\n   * Use official reporting method per client (needs\\_review):  \n     * Method A: Forward to dedicated phishing report email (e.g., phishing@clientorg.com)  \n     * Method B: Use \"Report Phishing\" button in email client if available  \n     * Method C: Create IT security ticket with email forwarded as attachment  \n   * Include in report: full email with headers (sender, date, subject)  \n   * Notify supervisor: \"I received suspicious email and reported via \\[method\\]. I did not click anything.\"  \n   * If you already clicked before recognizing: Report immediately as potential compromise per Module 6  \n3. **After reporting:**\n\n   * Delete suspicious email from inbox after confirmation IT received report  \n   * Watch for similar attempts (attackers often send waves)  \n   * If colleagues ask about similar email: direct them to report via official channel, do NOT forward your copy\n\n**Procedure: Phone-Based Social Engineering Defense**\n\n**Common phone social engineering scenarios:**\n\n* \"IT helpdesk\" requesting password for \"system upgrade\"  \n* \"Supervisor\" requesting urgent information transfer  \n* \"Vendor\" requesting confidential contract or patient information  \n* \"Colleague\" from different location asking for credentials or system access\n\n**Defense steps:**\n\n1. **Apply verification from Module 4:**\n\n   * Do not provide information or credentials based on caller claim alone  \n   * Request callback number and verify through official directory  \n   * If \"IT\": hang up, call official IT helpdesk number to verify request  \n   * If \"supervisor\": hang up, call supervisor's known number to verify  \n   * If \"vendor\": verify through contract or vendor registry, return call to known official number  \n2. **Never provide credentials over phone:**\n\n   * Legitimate IT never needs your password  \n   * If caller requests password: refuse, report as social engineering attempt  \n3. **Recognize pressure tactics:**\n\n   * Urgency: \"We need this now or systems will fail\\!\"  \n   * Authority: \"This is \\[executive name\\], I'm ordering you\\!\"  \n   * Intimidation: \"You'll be fired if you don't comply\\!\"  \n   * Helpfulness exploitation: \"I'm in crisis, please help\\!\"  \n   * If experiencing pressure: STOP, apply safe stop Rule 4, verify independently  \n4. **Document and report:**\n\n   * After suspicious call: document caller details (claimed name/role/organization, callback number provided, request made)  \n   * Report to IT security and supervisor  \n   * \"I received call from person claiming to be \\[X\\] requesting \\[Y\\]. I refused and am reporting for awareness.\"\n\n**Safe Stop Rules:**\n\n* Stop if email sender domain looks even slightly unfamiliar — verify before proceeding  \n* Stop if email requests credentials or urgent action — verify through separate channel  \n* Stop if feeling rushed to click/respond — slow down, apply full checklist  \n* Stop if caller requests password or PHI without proper verification — hang up, verify independently\n\n**Escalation Path:** IT security (for suspicious emails/calls) → Supervisor (for awareness) → Compliance (if credentials disclosed or link clicked)\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n\n* Suspicious email reports documented automatically when reported to IT  \n* Social engineering call attempts documented in IT security ticket  \n* If compromised (clicked link, opened attachment, disclosed credentials): Module 6 compromise response \\+ Module 10 incident response",

Click here to verify within 24 hours or account will be suspended. \\[Link\\]\"\n\nEmployee applies checklist:\n\n1. Sender address check: reveals micros0ft.com (zero instead of O) — RED FLAG  \n2. Domain look-alike: legitimate is microsoft.com, this is micros0ft.com — PHISHING  \n3. Urgency language: \"immediate,\" \"24 hours,\" \"suspended\" — manipulation tactics  \n4. Does not click link or reply  \n5. Reports via official channel: forwards to phishing@clientorg.com with note \"Suspected phishing \\- look-alike domain\"  \n6. Deletes email after IT confirmation  \n7. Notifies supervisor: \"Received and reported phishing attempt\"\n\n**Why Compliant:** Systematic checklist application, detected look-alike domain, did not click despite urgency pressure, reported properly, did not forward to colleagues. Source Scenario 3 directly addresses look-alike domain pattern.\n\n**Compliant Example 2 \\- CEO Fraud Recognition:** Email appears to be from CEO: **From:** Display name shows \"CEO Name\" but actual address is ceo@clientname-secure.com (note: legitimate is clientname.com, this adds \"-secure\") **Subject:** URGENT: Wire Transfer Needed **Body:** \"I'm in a meeting and need you to wire $50,000 to this vendor immediately for critical contract. I'll explain later. Here are wire details...\"\n\nEmployee recognizes:\n\n* CEO fraud pattern (authority \\+ urgency)  \n* Domain is not exact match (clientname-secure.com vs clientname.com)  \n* Request outside normal workflow (direct wire request to non-finance employee)  \n* \"I'll explain later\" avoids scrutiny\n\nEmployee response:\n\n* Does NOT proceed with wire transfer  \n* Calls CEO directly at known office number: \"I received email requesting urgent wire transfer. Can you confirm?\"  \n* CEO: \"I didn't send that. That's a scam. Report it.\"  \n* Employee reports to IT security as CEO fraud attempt  \n* Documents and notifies supervisor\n\n**Why Compliant:** Recognized authority manipulation, verified domain, independently confirmed with CEO through trusted channel, did not comply with fraudulent request, reported properly.\n\n**Non-Compliant Example:** Employee receives email from familiar colleague's address with unusual request: \"Hey, I'm working from home and my system isn't working. Can you send me the patient database export file? I need it for urgent report. Attach to reply. Thanks\\!\"\n\nEmail actually from legitimate colleague's compromised account (attacker has access).\n\nEmployee thinks: \"This is from my colleague Sarah, her email address is correct. She must really need help.\"\n\nEmployee attaches database export file (contains PHI) and replies with file.\n\n**Why Non-Compliant:** Multiple failures:\n\n* Did not verify unusual request through separate channel (should have called Sarah to confirm)  \n* Request was outside normal workflow and vague (\"urgent report\")  \n* Sent sensitive PHI file via email without verifying recipient's legitimate need and system security  \n* Even legitimate colleague's account could be compromised (should verify through phone/in-person)  \n* Creates incident: unauthorized PHI disclosure to compromised account  \n* Result: Module 10 incident response required, potential breach depending on attacker actions, sanctions likely (failure to verify unusual request, inappropriate file sharing)",

From: support@microsof1.com (1 instead of t) / Subject: Account verification / Urgent tone → PHISHING  \n2. From: colleague@clientorg.com / Subject: Meeting notes attached / Expected meeting notes → SAFE (assuming verified context)  \n3. From: noreply@paypal-secure.com / Subject: Your payment is pending / Link to update payment → PHISHING (paypal-secure.com is not legitimate paypal.com)  \n4. From: IT@clientorg.com / Subject: Password expiration notice / Links to internal password reset portal → SUSPICIOUS (verify through official IT channel; legitimate IT doesn't usually request password change via email link)  \n5. From: vendor@knownvendor.com / Subject: Invoice \\#12345 / PDF attachment / No prior vendor relationship → SUSPICIOUS (unexpected vendor invoice)  \n6. From: hr@clientorg.com / Subject: Benefits enrollment deadline / Links to known benefits portal → SAFE (if context appropriate and domain verified)  \n7. From: ceo@clientorg.com (display name) but actual address is ceo@clientname-services.com / Urgent wire transfer request → PHISHING (domain mismatch, CEO fraud pattern)  \n8. From: security@clientorg.com / \"Your account has been compromised\\! Click immediately\\!\" → PHISHING (urgency \\+ fear tactics, even if domain looks right, verify independently)  \n9. From: patient@gmail.com / Subject: Question about my bill / Legitimate patient inquiry → SAFE (if patient communication expected; verify identity per Module 4 before responding with PHI)  \n10. From: colleague@clientorg.com / Subject: Check this out\\! / Generic link with no context → SUSPICIOUS (unusual pattern even from known colleague; verify with colleague via phone before clicking)  \n11. From: shipping@fedex-tracking.com / \"Package delivery failed, click to reschedule\" / Not expecting package → PHISHING (unsolicited, look-alike domain possibly)  \n12. From: insurance@knownpayer.com / Subject: Claim update for patient \\[name\\] / Expected payer communication → SAFE (if domain verified and communication expected)  \n13. From: helpdesk@clientorg.com / \"Reply with your password to verify identity\" → PHISHING (IT never requests passwords, even if domain appears legitimate)  \n14. From: supervisor@clientorg.com / Subject: Performance review scheduled / Calendar invite → SAFE (if supervisor communication expected and domain verified)  \n15. From: unknown@randomdomain.ru / Subject: You have won $1,000,000\\! / Click here to claim → PHISHING (obvious)  \n16. From: billing@hospital-billing-dept.com / Invoice for services / Your organization is hospital.com → PHISHING (look-alike domain with added words)  \n17. From: noreply@linkedin.com / \"Someone viewed your profile\" / You have LinkedIn account → SUSPICIOUS (verify domain is legitimate linkedin.com; common phishing target)  \n18. From: admin@clientorg.com / Subject: System maintenance tonight / Informational notice / No links or attachments → SAFE (informational only, domain legitimate)  \n19. From: finance@clientorg.com / Subject: W2 form attached / Tax season appropriate timing / PDF from known HR system → SAFE (if expected and verified context)  \n20. From: printer@clientorg.com / \"Scanned document attached\" / You didn't scan anything → SUSPICIOUS (could be legitimate misrouted scan or malware; verify before opening)\n\n**Scoring:** 80% \\= 16/20 correct classifications\n\n**Scenario Exercise: Link Hover Practice**\n\nFor each scenario, describe what you see when hovering and what you do:\n\n**Scenario 1:** Email text shows link as \"Click here to reset password: https://microsoft.com\" but hover reveals actual destination \"https://micros0ft-login.ru\" **Response:** Link destination does NOT match displayed text or legitimate domain. Phishing. Do not click. Report.\n\n**Scenario 2:** Email from IT with text \"Visit our new portal: https://clientorg.com/newportal\" and hover shows \"https://clientorg.com/newportal\" **Response:** Link matches displayed text and legitimate domain. Still verify with IT through separate channel before clicking (could be spoofed email claiming to be IT). If verified legitimate, safe to click.\n\n**Scenario 3:** Email with text \"Update your insurance info here\" but link is shortened URL \"bit.ly/abc123\" **Response:** Shortened URLs hide actual destination. Cannot verify legitimacy through hover. Do not click. Report as suspicious.\n\n**Mini-Simulation Script:** **Trainer plays:** Caller claiming to be IT  \n **Learner plays:** Employee applying social engineering defense\n\n**Trainer:** \"Hi, this is Tom from IT helpdesk. We're doing system upgrades tonight and I need to verify your account credentials. What's your username and password?\"\n\n**Learner expected actions:**\n\n1. Recognize red flag: IT requesting credentials over phone  \n2. Refuse: \"Our policy is that I don't provide my password to anyone, including IT. IT can reset my password if needed, but doesn't need my current password.\"  \n3. If caller persists: \"I need to verify this request. What's your employee ID and I'll call IT helpdesk back at the official number.\"  \n4. End call professionally  \n5. Call official IT helpdesk number: \"Someone just called claiming to be IT requesting my password. Can you confirm if Tom from IT called me?\"  \n6.

What do you do? A) Click since displayed text says microsoft.com  \n B) Do not click; link destination doesn't match, likely phishing  \n C) Click but watch for suspicious behavior  \n D) Ask colleague to click to verify\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Link destination mismatch is phishing indicator; hover reveals deception.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — displayed text can be different from actual destination.\n\n**Item 6 (MCQ):** Legitimate IT department will: A) Sometimes request your password over email for troubleshooting  \n B) Request your password over phone during emergencies  \n C) Never request your password; they can reset it without knowing current password  \n D) Only request password from trusted long-term employees\n\n**Answer:** C  \n **Rationale:** IT never needs user passwords; requesting password indicates social engineering.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — IT requests are common phishing pattern.\n\n**Item 7 (True/False):** CEO fraud is phishing pattern where attacker impersonates executive to pressure urgent inappropriate action.\n\n**Answer:** True  \n **Rationale:** CEO fraud exploits authority and urgency (source identifies as common pattern).\n\n**Item 8 (MCQ):** Unexpected attachment with file type \".exe\" should: A) Be opened to see what it contains  \n B) Not be opened; executable files are high-risk, report as suspicious  \n C) Be scanned by antivirus then opened  \n D) Be opened in safe mode\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Unexpected .exe attachments are high malware risk; do not open.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — even with antivirus, unexpected executables should be reported, not opened.\n\n**Item 9 (Scenario MCQ):** Caller claims to be your supervisor and urgently demands patient information. Caller ID shows unknown number. What do you do? A) Provide information since it's your supervisor  \n B) Hang up and call supervisor at known number to verify  \n C) Ask caller to prove identity through personal questions  \n D) Provide information but document afterward\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Verify claimed identity through independent trusted channel, never based on call alone.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** A — authority claim doesn't override verification requirement.\n\n**Item 10 (MCQ):** \"Too good to be true\" offers in email are: A) Legitimate prizes from marketing campaigns  \n B) Manipulation tactic to trigger impulsive clicking  \n C) Safe if sender domain looks legitimate  \n D) Worth checking out if curious\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Extreme offers (too good or too bad) are manipulation tactics.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** D — curiosity is attacker's goal.\n\n**Item 11 (True/False):** If email is from a colleague's legitimate address, it's safe to trust the content.\n\n**Answer:** False  \n **Rationale:** Colleague's account could be compromised; verify unusual requests through separate channel.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** True — assuming legitimate address \\= legitimate content.\n\n**Item 12 (MCQ):** Shortened URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl) in emails should be: A) Clicked to see where they go  \n B) Avoided; destination is hidden, increasing phishing risk  \n C) Safe if from known sender  \n D) Opened in incognito mode for safety\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Shortened URLs hide destination, preventing hover verification; increased risk.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — shortened URLs can be in compromised colleague's email.\n\n**Item 13 (Scenario MCQ):** After you click link in phishing email and enter credentials on fake site, you realize the mistake. What do you do immediately? A) Do nothing and hope for the best  \n B) Change password immediately, report to IT and supervisor as compromise per Module 6  \n C) Just change password quietly  \n D) Wait to see if anything bad happens\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Immediate compromise response: password change, escalation, documentation per Module 6\\.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — reporting required, not just password change.\n\n**Item 14 (Short Answer):** What are the three elements you verify when hovering over a link?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. Actual destination URL/domain  \n2. Whether destination matches displayed link text  \n3. Whether destination domain matches legitimate expected organization\n\n**Rationale:** Link hover reveals actual destination for verification.\n\n**Item 15 (MCQ):** Phishing simulation exercises (tests sent by IT security) should be: A) Ignored since they're just tests  \n B) Reported via official channel just like real phishing  \n C) Clicked to show you can identify them  \n D) Forwarded to colleagues as examples\n\n**Answer:** B  \n **Rationale:** Treat all suspicious emails the same; reporting simulations demonstrates proper behavior.  \n **Common Wrong Answer:** C — clicking defeats purpose of security test.",
